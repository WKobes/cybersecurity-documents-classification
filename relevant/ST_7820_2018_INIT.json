examination of the presidency text i. introduction for the purpose of discussion in the wp tele meeting of 19 april, delegations will find in annex a revised text of the eprivacy proposal (epr), focusing on chapters i, ii and ii i and the related recitals . the revisions are based on the discussions held in the wp tele on 13 and 28 march a nd on the written comments provided by delegations. 7820/18 km/ek 2 dge2b en for the sake of completeness, the presidency has included in annex all articles that belong to the above -mentioned chapters (except a rticle 11 and the related recital 26), even though not all of them h ave been amended. delegations will find the overview of the modifications in section ii below. for ease of reference, the latest changes to the text in annex are underlined . ii. amendments to the text a. link to gdpr following comments from a number of delegations, recital 2aa has been simplified . wording of recital 2a has been reshuffled to provide further clarity on the lex specialis relation of epr to gdpr. b. a rticle 6: permitted processing the presidency has noted the interest of some delegations to further develop the permitted processing of electronic communications metadata. with this in mind, the presidency has introduced two main changes in article 6: - art. 6(2)(a) has been expanded to allow processing for purposes of network management and optimisation; - the presidency has added a new basis for processing in art. 6(2)(f) for the purpose of statistical counting. the new basis is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled and is accompanied by art. 6(3a) , which introduces a number of safeguards to be applied when this grounds is used. 7820/18 km/ek 3 dge2b en other changes to article 6 are as follows : - the presidency has deleted art. 6(2)(ba) on legal obligation, as it considered that this point partially overla pped with article 11 and created interpretation issues; - art. 6(2)(d) has been reworded to better serve its purpose, as the protection of vital interest might encompass situations where the end -user is actually not physically or legally incapable of givin g consent. the presidency has added a requirement of a request by a competent authority, to avoid that providers have to decide themselves when vital interests are at stake. c. a rticle 8: protection of end -users' terminal equipment information it has bee n clarified in art. 8(2)(a) that collection of terminal equipment information is allowed not only for the purpose of establishing but also for the purpose of maintaining a connection. in recitals 20 and 21 the word 'device' has been replaced by 'identifie r' as it seems to be a more correct terminology in relation to cookies. moreover, recital 21 now provides an example where making access to a website conditional on the acceptance of cookies is not considered justified. recital 21a includes a new example of cookies that can be legitimate and useful tools. d. a rticle 10: privacy settings following questions by some delegation s with regard to the addressees of the obligation set out in art. 10(1) , the presidency would like to clari fy that this applies to anyone who places the software on the market, be it its manufacturer, importer or distributor. this is in line with art. 3(1)(ca) and with eu law in other sectors, which introduces requirements for services or products placed on the market. 7820/18 km/ek 4 dge2b en the presidency has further improved art. 10(2) by removing the ambiguity of 'periodic intervals' and linking the information on the settings to 'every update' instead. in addition, the presidency has introduced the obligation to navigate the end -user through the privacy settings to make sure that end -users are fully aware of them. the presidency has also noted the concerns of some delegations with regard to software that is placed on the market but is no longer updated , and is reflecting how to address this issue. recitals 22 to 24 have been aligned to article 10. in addition, recital 24 clarifies that updates of software should not alter the privacy settings selected by the end -users. e. a rticle 13: exceptions to pres entations and restriction of cli a minor improvement has been introduced in art. 13(1) . text of art. 13(3) has been aligned with language of art. 13(1). a new sentence in recital 28 recalls that delegated acts adopted on the basis of the radio equipment directive (2014/53/eu) might require specific radio equipment to support certain features ensuring access to emergency services . f. a rticle 15: publicly available directories the presidency has noted the wish of some delegations to keep the flexibility provided by the current eprivacy directive as well as concerns of other delegations about the lack of clarity of the text of art. 15(1). in an attempt to address both concerns , the presidency proposes the following solution: 7820/18 km/ek 5 dge2b en - reverting back to the (slig htly simplified) original commission proposal of art. 15(1) which requires consent, as a default rule, - providing for a possibility in new art. 15(1aa) for member states to have an opt -out system , and - deleting the word 'additional' in art. 15(2) . moreover, in order to make clear t hat member states may maintain their current regimes as to the addressees of the obligations in art. 15(1a),(2), (3) and (3a), the presidency has introduced new art. 15(3aa) . thus, obligations of these provisions apply to number -based ics providers, unless member states' law provides that they apply to providers of directories or to both types of providers. deletions in art. 15(1a), (2), (3) and (3a) reflect this approach. recitals 30 and 31 have been aligned to article 15 . in recital 30 , it has been clarified that the treatment of natural persons acting in professional capacity as legal persons applies only to provisions on publicly available directories. g. article 16: direct marketing the word 'unsolicited' has been reintroduced in the title of the article. art. 16(1) has been reworded as a proh ibition instead of a permission without, however, changing the substance of the provision. a minor language improvement has been introduced in the last sentence of art. 16(2) . art. 16(2a) leaves it for member states to decide, if the y so wish, what is the appropriate time limit for using customers' contact details for direct marketing. the word 'customer' has been replaced by 'end -user who is a natural person' for consistency purposes. 7820/18 km/ek 6 dge2b en in art. 16(6)(a) the word 'true' has been replace d by 'effective'. art. 16(6)(c) and (d) have been merged to avoid unnecessary duplication. the word 'present' has been removed throughout the text of the articl e and related recitals as the presidency considers, following comments by some delegations, that 'send' is sufficient in connection with direct marketing. as a consequence of the previous change, new art. 16(6a) has been removed as redundant. delegations are reminded that similar clarification is still present in recital 32. h. other elements further clarifications have been introduced in recital 8 on processing of electronic communications data by end -users as recipients or other parties on their behal f, which is not covered by epr. in recital 11 , the presidency has introduced examples of services that are not considered interpersonal communications services, such as linear broadcasting, video on demand, or others. new recital 15aa clarifies that the eecc and gdpr apply to providers of electronic communications services with regard to security measures. the recital also clarifies that trade secrets are protected by directive (eu) 2016/943. recital 16 clarifies that the concept of 'security' covers availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality. it also makes clear that processing of metadata to make it anonymous is allowed. the presidency has not introduced any new text with regard to 'anci llary services' but plans to work on further improvements of the relevant provisions. 7820/18 km/ek 7 annex dge2b en annex (1) article 7 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union (\"the charter\") protects the fundamental right of everyone to the respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications. respect for the privacy of one\u2122s communications is an essential dimension of this right , applying both to natural and legal persons . confidentiality of electronic communications ensures that information exchanged between parties and the external elements of such communication, including when the informa tion has been sent, from where, to whom, is not to be revealed to anyone other than to the parties involved in a communication. the principle of confidentiality should apply to current and future means of communication, including calls, internet access, in stant messaging applications, e -mail, internet phone calls and personal messaging provided through social media. (2) the content of electronic communications may reveal highly sensitive information about the natural persons involved in the communication, from personal experiences and emotions to medical conditions, sexual preferences and political views, the disclosure of which could result in personal and social harm, economic loss or embarrassment. similarly, metadata derived from electronic communicatio ns may also reveal very sensitive and personal information. these metadata include s the numbers called, the websites visited, geographical location, the time, date and duration when an individual made a call etc., allowing precise conclusions to be drawn r egarding the private lives of the persons involved in the electronic communication, such as their social relationships, their habits and activities of everyday life, their interests, tastes etc. (2aa) regulation (eu) 2016/679 regulates the protection of personal data. this regulation protects in addition the respect for private life and communications , which applies both to end -users who are natural persons and who are legal persons . 7820/18 km/ek 8 annex dge2b en (2a) the provis ions of this regulation particularise and complement the general rules on the protection of personal data laid down in regu lation (eu) 2016/679 as regards data that qualify as personal data. this regulation therefore does not lower the level of protection enjoyed by natural persons under regulation (eu) 2016/679. the provisions particularise regulation (eu) 2016/679 by translating its principles into specific rules. if no specific rules are established in this regulation, regulation (eu) 2016/679 should app ly to any processing of data that qualify as personal data. the y provisions complement regulation (eu) 2016/679 by setting forth rules regarding subject matters that are not within the scope of regulation (eu) 2016/679 , such as the protection of the rights of end -users who are legal persons . this regulation therefore does not lower the level of protection enjoyed by natural persons under regulation (eu) 2016/679. processing of electronic communications data by providers of electronic communications services and networks should only be permitted in accordance with this regulation. if no specific rules are established in this regulation, regulation (eu) 2016/679 sh ould apply to any processing of data that qualify as personal data. insofar as end -users who are legal persons are concerned, provisions of regulation (eu) 2016/679 should apply only to the extent specifically required by this regulation. 7820/18 km/ek 9 annex dge2b en (3) electronic communications data may also reveal information concerning legal en tities, such as business secrets or other sensitive information that has economic value and the protection of which allows legal persons to conduct their business, supporting among other innovation . therefore, the provisions of this regulation should in pr inciple apply to both natural and legal persons. furthermore, this regulation should ensure that , where necessary, provisions of the regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council 1, also apply mutatis mutandis to end -users who are l egal persons. this includes the definition of provisions on consent under regulation (eu) 2016/679. when reference is made to consent by an end -user, including legal persons, this definition should apply. in addition, legal persons should have the same rig hts as end -users that are natural persons regarding the supervisory authorities; furthermore, supervisory authorities under this regulation should also be responsible for monitoring the application of this regulation regarding legal persons. (3a) this regulation should not affect national law regulating for instance the conclusion or the validity of a contract. similarly, this regulation should not affect national law in relation to determining who has the legal power to represent legal persons in any dealings with third parties or in legal proceedings. (4) pursuant to article 8(1) of the charter and article 16(1) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union, everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. regul ation (eu) 2016/679 lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. electronic communications data may include personal data as defined i n regulation (eu) 2016/679. 1 regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing directive 95/46/ec (general data protection regulation) (oj l 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1 \u015388). 7820/18 km/ek 10 annex dge2b en (5) the provisions of this regulation particularise and complement the general rules on the protection of personal data laid down in regulation (eu) 2016/679 as regards electronic communications data that qualify as personal data. this regulation therefore does not lower the level of protection enjoyed by natural persons under regulation (eu) 2016/679. processing of electronic communications data by providers of electronic communications services should only be permitted in ac cordance with this regulation. (6) while the principles and main provisions of directive 2002/58/ec of the european parliament and of the council 2 remain generally sound, that directive has not fully kept pace with the evolution of technological and marke t reality, resulting in an inconsistent or insufficient effective protection of privacy and confidentiality in relation to electronic communications. those developments include the entrance on the market of electronic communications services that from a co nsumer perspective are substitutable to traditional services, but do not have to comply with the same set of rules. another development concerns new techniques that allow for tracking of online behaviour of end -users, which are not covered by directive 200 2/58/ec. directive 2002/58/ec should therefore be repealed and replaced by this regulation. (7) the member states should be allowed, within the limits of this regulation, to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify and clarify the appli cation of the rules of this regulation in order to ensure an effective application and interpretation of those rules. therefore, the margin of discretion, which member states have in this regard, should maintain a balance between the protection of private life and personal data and the free movement of electronic communications data. 2 directive 2002/58/ec of t he european parliament and of the council of 12 july 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (directive on privacy and electronic communications) (oj l 201, 31.7.2002, p.37). 7820/18 km/ek 11 annex dge2b en (8) this regulation should apply to providers of electronic communications services, to providers of publicly available directories, and to software providers of software permitting electronic communications, including the retrieval and presentation of information on the internet. this regulation should also apply to natural and legal persons who use electronic communications services to send or present direct marketing comme rcial communications or make use of processing and storage capabilities of terminal equipment or collect information related to processed by or emitted by or stored in end -users\u2122 terminal equipment. furthermore, this regulation should apply regardless of whether the processing of electronic communications data or personal data of end -users who are in the union takes place in the union or not, or of whether the service provider or person processing such data is established or located in the union or not. some end -users , such as financial institutions, process as recipients their electronic communications data for different purposes or permit other parties to process their data on their behalf. , ssuch processing may include the processing by a website provid er, or another party on its behalf, for purposes such as ensuring network and information security , including the prevention and termination of distributed denial of service attacks, or facilitating efficient delivery of website content . such processing is not covered by this regulation. (9) this regulation should apply to electronic communications data processed in connection with the provision and use of electronic communications services in the union, regardless of whether or not the processing takes pla ce in the union. moreover, in order not to deprive end -users in the union of effective protection, this regulation should also apply to electronic communications data processed in connection with the provision of electronic communications services from out side the union to end -users in the union. 7820/18 km/ek 12 annex dge2b en (10) radio equipment and its software which is placed on the internal market in the union, must comply with directive 2014/53/eu of the european parliament and of the council 3. this regulation should not affect the applicability of any of the requirements of directive 2014/53/eu nor the power of the commission to adopt delegated acts pursuant to directive 2014/53/eu requiring that specific categories or classes of radio equipment incorporate safeguards to ensure that personal data and privacy of end -users are protected. (11) the services used for communications purposes, and the technical means of their delivery, have evolved considerably. end -users increasingly replace traditional voice telephony, text messages ( sms) and electronic mail conveyance services in favour of functionally equivalent online services such as voice over ip, messaging services and web -based e -mail services. in order to ensure an effective and equal protection of end -users when using function ally equivalent services, this regulation uses the definition of electronic communications services set forth in the [directive of the european parliament and of the council establishing the european electronic communications code 4]. that definition encomp asses not only internet access services and services consisting wholly or partly in the conveyance of signals but also interpersonal communications services, which may or may not be number -based, such as for example, voice over ip, messaging services and w eb-based e -mail services. services such as linear broadcasting, video on demand, websites, social networks, blogs, or exchange of information between machines, should not be considered as interpersonal communications services. 3 directive 2014/53/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 16 april 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment and repealing directive 1999/5/ec (oj l 153, 22.5.201 4, p. 62). 4 commission proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council establishing the european electronic communications code (recast) (com/2016/0590 final - 2016/0288 (cod)). 7820/18 km/ek 13 annex dge2b en (11a) the protection of con fidentiality of communications is crucial also as regards interpersonal communications services that are ancillary to another service; therefore, the processing of electronic communications data in the context of the provision of such type of ancillary services also having a communication functionality should be covered by this regulation. in such cases, this regulation applies only to the ancillary feature itself and the electronic communications functionality it provides. to determine whether an electroni c communications functionality constitutes an ancillary feature, the end -users expectations have to be taken into account. for example such communications functionality is considered to be ancillary feature in in all the circumstances where electronic communication is taking place between a finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of end -users which is determined by the sender of the communications, e.g. any messaging application allowing two or more people to connect and communicate, such services constitute interpersonal communications services. conversely, a communications channel does not constitute an interpersonal communications service when it does not enable direct interpersonal and intera ctive exchange of information via electronic communications networks between a finite number of persons, whereby the persons initiating or participating in the communication determine its recipient(s). this is for example the case when the entity providing the communications channel is at the same time a communicating party, such as a company that operates a communications channel for customer care that allows customers solely to communicate with the company in question. however also, where access to an ele ctronic communications functionality is available for anyone, e.g. communications in an electronic communications channel in online games which is open to all persons playing the game, such channel does not constitute an ancillary interpersonal communicati ons feature. this reflects the end -users' expectations regarding the confidentiality of a service. 7820/18 km/ek 14 annex dge2b en (12) connected devices and machines increasingly communicate with each other by using electronic communications networks (internet of things). the use of m achine -to-machine services, that is to say services involving an automated transfer of data and information between devices or software -based applications with limited or no human interaction, is emerging. while the services provided at the application -lay er of such services do normally not qualify as an electronic communications service as defined in the [directive establishing the european electronic communications code], tthe transmission services used for the provision of machine -to-machine communication s services regularly involves the conveyance of signals over via an electronic communications network and, hence, usually normally constitutes an electronic communications service. in order to ensure full protection of the rights to privacy and confidentia lity of communications, and to promote a trusted and secure internet of things in the digital single market, it is necessary to clarify that this regulation , in particular the requirements relating to the confidentiality of communications, should apply to the transmission of machine -to-machine electronic communications where carried out via an electronic communications service . therefore, the principle of confidentiality enshrined in this regulation should also apply to the transmission of machine -to-machin e communications. specific safeguards could also be adopted under sectorial legislation, as for instance directive 2014/53/eu. 7820/18 km/ek 15 annex dge2b en (13) the development of fast and efficient wireless technologies has fostered the increasing availability for the public of internet access via wireless networks accessible by anyone in public and semi -private spaces such as 'hotspots' situated at different places within a city, department stores, shopping malls and hospitals. to the extent that those communications networks ar e provided to an undefined group of end -users, regardless if these networks are secured with passwords or not, the confidentiality of the communications transmitted through such networks should be protected. the fact that wireless electronic communication s services may be ancillary to other services should not stand in the way of ensuring the protection of confidentiality of communications data and application of this regulation. therefore , this regulation should apply to electronic communications data usi ng electronic communications services and public communications networks. in contrast, this regulation should not apply to closed groups of end -users such as corporate networks, access to which is limited pre -defined group of end -users, e.g. to members of the corporation. therefore, o nly networks proving access to a group of end -users which is not pre -defined and where end -users get access to the network under the same conditions, e.g. wifi network of a department store open to all customers, are regulated by this regulation. 7820/18 km/ek 16 annex dge2b en (14) electronic communications data should be defined in a sufficiently broad and technology neutral way so as to encompass any information concerning the content transmitted or exchanged (electronic communications content) and the information concerning an end -user of electronic communications services processed for the purposes of transmitting, distributing or enabling the exchange of electronic communications content; including data to trace and identify the source and destination of a communication, geograph ical location and the date, time, duration and the type of communication. whether such signals and the related data are conveyed by wire, radio, optical or electromagnetic means, including satellite networks, cable networks, fixed (circuit - and packet -swit ched, including internet) and mobile terrestrial networks, electricity cable systems, the data related to such signals should be considered as electronic communications metadata and therefore be subject to the provisions of this regulation. electronic comm unications metadata may include information that is part of the subscription to the service when such information is processed for the purposes of transmitting, distributing or exchanging electronic communications content. 7820/18 km/ek 17 annex dge2b en (15) electronic communicatio ns data should be treated as confidential. this means that any interference with the transmission processing of electronic communications data, whether directly by human intervention or through the intermediation of automated processing by machines, withou t the consent of all the communicating parties should be prohibited. the prohibition of interception of communications data should apply during their conveyance, i.e. until receipt of the content of the electronic communication by the intended addressee . interception of electronic communications data may occur, for example, when someone other than the communicating parties, listens to calls, reads, scans or stores the content of electronic communications, or the associated metadata for purposes other than t he exchange of communications. interception also occurs when third parties monitor websites visited, timing of the visits, interaction with others, etc., without the consent of the end -user concerned. as technology evolves, the technical ways to engage in interception have also increased. such ways may range from the installation of equipment that gathers data from terminal equipment over targeted areas, such as the so -called imsi (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, to programs and techniqu es that, for example, surreptitiously monitor browsing habits for the purpose of creating end -user profiles. other examples of interception include capturing payload data or content data from unencrypted wireless networks and routers, including browsing ha bits without the end -users' consent. (15aa) in order to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications data, providers of electronic communications services should apply security measures in accordance with article 40 of the [directive establishing the european electronic communications code] and article 32 of regulation (eu) 2016/679 . moreover, trade secrets are protected in accordance with directive (eu) 2016/943. 7820/18 km/ek 18 annex dge2b en (15a) the prohibition of interception of communications data should app ly during their conveyance, i.e. until receipt of the content of the electronic communication by the intended addressee. the exact moment of the completion of the transmission of electronic communications content may depend on the type of electronic commun ications service that is provided. for instance for a voice call the transmission will be completed as soon as either of the end -users terminates the connection. for electronic mail or instant messaging the transmission is completed as soon as the addresse e has collected the message, typically from the server of the electronic communications service provider. upon completion of the transmission, electronic communications content and related metadata should be erased or made anonymous by the provider of the electronic communications service except when processing is permitted under this regulation or when the end -users has entrusted the provider of the electronic communications service or another third party to record, store or otherwise process such data in accordance with regulation (eu) 2016/679. (16) the prohibition of storage of communications is not intended to prohibit any automatic, intermediate and transient storage of this information insofar as this takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the electronic communications network. it should not prohibit either the processing of electronic communications data to ensure the security and continuity , including the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality, of the electronic communications services, including for example checking security threats such as the presence of malware . or neither should it prohibit the processing of metadata to ensure the necessary quality of service requirements, such as latency, jitter etc . nor the processing of metadata to make it anonymous nor the processing of metadata to make it anonymou s. 7820/18 km/ek 19 annex dge2b en (17) the processing of electronic communications data can be useful for businesses, consumers and society as a whole. vis -\u00e0-vis directive 2002/58/ec, this regulation broadens the possibilities for providers of electronic communications services to process elect ronic communications metadata, based on end -users consent. however, end -users attach great importance to the confidentiality of their communications, including their online activities, and that they want to control the use of electronic communications data for purposes other than conveying the communication. therefore, this regulation should require providers of electronic communications services to obtain end -users' consent to process electronic communications metadata, which should include data on the loc ation of the device generated for the purposes of granting and maintaining access and connection to the service. location data that is generated other than in the context of providing electronic communications services should not be considered as metadata. examples of commercial usages of electronic communications metadata by providers of electronic communications services may include the provision of heatmaps; a graphical representation of data using colors to indicate the presence of individuals. to displ ay the traffic movements in certain directions during a certain period of time, an identifier is necessary to link the positions of individuals at certain time intervals. this identifier would be missing if anonymous data were to be used and such movement could not be displayed. such usage of electronic communications metadata could, for example, benefit public authorities and public transport operators to define where to develop new infrastructure, based on the usage of and pressure on the existing structu re. where a type of processing of electronic communications metadata, in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, a data protection impact assessment and, as the case may be, a consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing, in accordance with articles 35 and 36 of regulation (eu) 2016/679. 7820/18 km/ek 20 annex dge2b en (17a) the processing o f electronic communications metadata should also be regarded to be permitted where it is necessary in order to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the end -users who are natural persons or that of another natural person. processing of ele ctronic communications metadata of an end -user for the protection of the vital interest of an end -user who is a natural person should in principle take place only where the protection of such interests cannot be ensured without that processing. (17b) proc essing of electronic communication metadata for scientific research or statistical purposes should be considered to be permitted processing. this type of processing should be subjct to further safeguards to ensure privacy of the end -users by employing appr opriate security measures such as encryption and pseudonymisation. in addtion, end -users who are natural persons should be given the right to object. (18) end -users may consent to the processing of their metadata to receive specific services such as protec tion services against fraudulent activities (by analysing usage data, location and customer account in real time). in the digital economy, services are often supplied against counter -performance other than money, for instance by end -users being exposed to advertisements. for the purposes of this regulation, consent of an end -user, regardless of whether the latter is a natural or a legal person, should have the same meaning and be subject to the same conditions as the data subject's consent under regulation (eu) 2016/679. basic broadband internet access and voice communications services are to be considered as essential services for individuals to be able to communicate and participate to the benefits of the digital economy. consent for processing electronic communications data from internet or voice communication usage will not be valid if the data subject end -user has no genuine and free choice, or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. 7820/18 km/ek 21 annex dge2b en (19) the protection of the content of electronic communications pertains to the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private and family life, home and communications protected under article 7 of the charter. any interference with the content of electronic communications should be allowed only under very clear defined conditions, for specific purposes and be subject to adequate safeguards against abuse. this regulation provides for the possibility of providers of electronic communications services to process electronic com munications data in transit, with the informed consent of all the end -users concerned. for example, providers may offer services that entail the scanning of emails to remove certain pre -defined material. given the sensitivity of the content of communicatio ns, this regulation sets forth a presumption that the processing of such content data will result in high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. when processing such type of data, the provider of the electronic communications service should a lways consult the supervisory authority prior to the processing. such consultation should be in accordance with article 36 (2) and (3) of regulation (eu) 2016/679. the presumption does not encompass the processing of content data to provide a service reque sted by the end -user where the end -user has consented to such processing and it is carried out for the purposes and duration strictly necessary and proportionate for such service. after electronic communications content has been sent by the end -user and re ceived by the intended end -user or end -users, it may be recorded or stored by the end -user, end -users or by a third party entrusted by them to record or store such data. any processing of such data must comply with regulation (eu) 2016/679. 7820/18 km/ek 22 annex dge2b en (19a) servic es that facilitate end -users everyday life such as index functionality, personal assistant, translation services and services that enable more inclusion for persons with disabilities such as text -to-speech services are emerging. therefore, processing elect ronic communications content for services explicitly requested by the end -user for their own individual use, consent should only be requested from the end -user requesting the service taking into account that the processing must be limited to that purpose, limited to the duration necessary for providing the requested services and shall not adversely affect fundamental rights and interest of another end -user concerned. (19b) providers of electronic communications services may, for example, obtain the consen t of the end -user for the processing of electronic communications data, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, and any moment in time thereafter. in some cases, the legal entity having subscribed to the electronic communications service may allow a natural person, such as an employee, to make use of the service. in such case, consent needs to be obtained from the individual concerned. 7820/18 km/ek 23 annex dge2b en (20) terminal equipment of end -users of electronic communications networks and any information relating to the usage of such terminal equipment, whether in particular is stored in processed by or emitted by or stored in such equipment, requested from or process ed in order to enable it to connect to another device and or network equipment, are part of the private sphere , including the privacy of one\u2122s communications, of the end -users requiring protection under the charter of fundamental rights of the european uni on and the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms . given that such equipment contains or processes information that may reveal details of an individual's emotional, political, social complexities, including the cont ent of communications, pictures, the location of individuals by accessing the device\u2122s gps capabilities, contact lists, and other information already stored in the device, the information related to such equipment requires enhanced privacy protection. furt hermore, the so -called spyware, web bugs, hidden identifiers, tracking cookies and other similar unwanted tracking tools can enter end -user's terminal equipment without their knowledge in order to gain access to information, to store hidden information and to trace the activities. information related to the end -user\u2122s device may also be collected remotely for the purpose of identification and tracking, using techniques such as the so -called \u201adevice fingerprinting\u2122, often without the knowledge of the end -use r, and may seriously intrude upon the privacy of these end -users. techniques that surreptitiously monitor the actions of end -users, for example by tracking their activities online or the location of their terminal equipment, or subvert the operation of the end -users\u2122 terminal equipment pose a serious threat to the privacy of end -users. therefore, any such interference with the end -user's terminal equipment should be allowed only with the end -user's consent and for specific and transparent purposes . the end -user's consent to storage of a cookie or similar device identifier may also entail consent for the subsequent readings of the cookie in the context of a revisit to the same website domain initially visited by the end -user. 7820/18 km/ek 24 annex dge2b en (21) exceptions to the obligation to obtain consent to make use of the processing and storage capabilities of terminal equipment or to access information stored in terminal equipment should be limited to situations that involve no, or only very limited, intrusi on of privacy. for instance, consent should not be requested for authorizing the technical storage or access which is strictly necessary and proportionate for the legitimate purpose of enabling the use of a specific service explicitly requested by the end -user. this may include the storing of cookies for the duration of a single established session on a website to keep track of the end - user\u2122s input when filling in online forms over several pages , authentication session cookies used to verify the identity of end -users engaged in online transactions or cookies used to remember items selected by the end -user and placed in shopping basket . access to specific website content may still be made conditional on the well -informed acceptance of the storage of a cookie or similar device identifier , if it is used for a legitimate purpose. this will for example not be the case of a cookie which is recreated after the deletion by the end -user. 7820/18 km/ek 25 annex dge2b en (21a) cookies can also be a legitimate and useful tool, for example , in assessing the effectiveness of a delivered information society service, for example of website design and advertising or by helping to measur eing web traffic to the numbers of end -users visiting a website , certain pages of a website or the number of e nd-users of an application. this is not the case, however, regarding cookies and similar identifiers used to determine the nature of who is using the site . information society providers that engage in configuration checking to provide the service in compli ance with the end -user's settings and the mere logging of the fact that the end -user\u2122s device is unable to receive content requested by the end -user should not constitute access to such a device or use of the device processing capabilities. consent should not be necessary either when the purpose of using the processing storage capabilities of terminal equipment is to fix security vulnerablities and other security bugs, provided that such updates do not in any way change the functionality of the hardware or software or the privacy settings chosen by the end -user and the end -user has the possibility to postpone or turn off the automatic installation of such updates. software updates that do not exclusively have a security purpose, for example those intended to add new features to an application or improve its performance, should not fall under this exception. 7820/18 km/ek 26 annex dge2b en (22) the methods used for providing information and obtaining end -user's consent should be as user -friendly as possible. given the ubiquitous use of tra cking cookies and other tracking techniques, end -users are increasingly requested to provide consent to store such tracking cookies in their terminal equipment. as a result, end -users are overloaded with requests to provide consent. the use of technical me ans to provide consent, for example, through transparent and user -friendly settings, may address this problem. therefore, this regulation should provide for the possibility to express consent by using the appropriate settings of a browser or other applicat ion. the choices made by end -users when establishing its general privacy settings of a browser or other application should be binding on, and enforceable against, any third parties. (22a) web browsers are a type of software application that permits the re trieval and presentation of information on the internet. other types of applications, such as the ones that permit calling and messaging or provide route guidance, have also the same capabilities . web browsers mediate much of what occurs between the end -user and the website. from this perspective, they are in a privileged the position to play an active role to help the end -user to control the flow of information to and from the terminal equipment. more particularly web browsers may be used as gatekeepers, t hus helping end -users to prevent information from their terminal equipment (for example smart phone, tablet or computer) from being accessed or stored. 7820/18 km/ek 27 annex dge2b en (23) the principles of data protection by design and by default were codified under article 25 of regu lation (eu) 2016/679. currently, the default settings for cookies are set in most current browsers to \u201aaccept all cookies\u2122. therefore providers of software enabling the retrieval and presentation of information on the internet should have an obligation to configure the software so that it offers the option to prevent third parties from storing information on the terminal equipment; this is often presented as \u201areject third party cookies\u2122. end -users should be offered a set of privacy setting options, ranging from higher (for example, \u201anever accept cookies\u2122) to lower (for example, \u201aalways accept cookies\u2122) and intermediate (for example, \u201areject third party cookies\u2122 or \u201aonly accept first party cookies\u2122). such privacy settings should be presented offered in a an easily visible and intelligible manner. 7820/18 km/ek 28 annex dge2b en (24) for web browsers to be able to obtain end -users\u2122 consent as defined under regulation (eu) 2016/679, for example, to the storage of third party tracking cookies, they should, among others, require a clear a ffirmative action from the end -user of terminal equipment to signify his or her freely given, specific informed, and unambiguous agreement to the storage and access of such cookies in and from the terminal equipment. such action may be considered to be aff irmative, for example, if end -users are required to actively select \u201aaccept third party cookies\u2122 to confirm their agreement and are given the necessary information to make the choice. to this end, it it is necessary to require providers of software enablin g access to internet that, at the moment of installation or first use and at the moment of every update , end -users are informed about the possibility to choose the available privacy settings among the various options and ask them to make a choice . informat ion provided should not dissuade end -users from selecting higher privacy settings and should include relevant information about the default setting and about the risks associated with the different privacy settings, including those related to allowing thir d party cookies to be stored in the computer, including the compilation of long -term records of individuals' browsing histories and the use of such records to send targeted advertising . updates of software enabling access to internet should not alter the p rivacy settings selected by the end -user. web browsers are encouraged to provide easy ways for end -users to change the privacy settings at any time during use and to allow the user to make exceptions for or to whitelist certain websites or to specify for w hich websites (third) party cookies are always or never allowed. 7820/18 km/ek 29 annex dge2b en (25) accessing electronic communications networks requires the regular emission of certain data packets in order to discover or maintain a connection with the network or other devices on the network. furthermore, devices must have a unique address assigned in order to be identifiable on that network. wireless and cellular telephone standards similarly involve the emission of active signals containing unique identifiers such as a mac address, the imei (international mobile station equipment identity), the imsi , the wifi signal etc. a single wireless base station (i.e. a transmitter and receiver), such as a wireless access point, has a specific range within which such information may be captured . service providers have emerged who offer physical movements' tracking services based on the scanning of equipment related information with diverse functionalities, including people counting, such as providing data on the number of people waiting in line, ascertaining the number of people in a specific area, etc referred to as statistical counting for which the consent of end -users is not needed, provided that such counting is limited in time and space to the extent necessary for this purpose. providers sh ould also apply appropriate technical and organisations measures to ensure the level if security appropriate to the risks, including pseudonymisation of the data and making it anonymous or erase it as soon it is not longer needed for this purpose . provider s engaged in such practices should display prominent notices located on the edge of the area of coverage informing end -users prior to entering the defined area that the technology is in operation within a given perimeter, the purpose of the tracking, the p erson responsible for it and the existence of any measure the end -user of the terminal equipment can take to minimize or stop the collection. additional information should be provided where personal data are collected pursuant to article 13 of regulation ( eu) 2016/679. this information may be used for more intrusive purposes, which should not be considered statistical counting, such as to send commercial messages to end -users, for example when they enter stores, with personalized offers . while some of these functionalities do not entail high privacy risks, others do, for example, those involving as well as the tracking of individuals over time, including repeated visits to specified locations. providers engaged in such practices should display prominent notices located on the edge of the area of coverage informing end -users prior to entering the defined area that the technology is in operation within a given perimeter, the purpose of the tracking, the person responsible for it and the existence of any measure the end -user of the terminal equipment can take to minimize or stop the collection. 7820/18 km/ek 30 annex dge2b en additional information should be provided where personal data are collected pursuant to article 13 of regulation (eu) 2016/679. \u2013 (27) as regards calling line identif ication, it is necessary to protect the right of the calling party to withhold the presentation of the identification of the line from which the call is being made and the right of the called party to reject calls from unidentified lines. certain end -users , in particular help lines, and similar organisations, have an interest in guaranteeing the anonymity of their callers. as regards connected line identification, it is necessary to protect the right and the legitimate interest of the called party to withho ld the presentation of the identification of the line to which the calling party is actually connected. (28) there is justification for overriding the elimination of calling line identification presentation in specific cases. end -users' rights to privacy with regard to calling line identification should be restricted where this is necessary to trace malicious or nuisance calls and with regard to calling line identification and location data where this is necessary to allow emergency services, such as ecall , to carry out their tasks as effectively as possible. location information established by the terminal equipment, using its built -in global navigation satellite systems (gnss) capabilities or other types of terminal equipment based location data, such as location data derived from the wifi functionality , may supplement the location data supplied by providers of number -based interpersonal communications services when a call is made to emergency services. the temporary denial or absence of consent of an en d-user to access location data provided by the terminal equipment gnss, for example, because location settings are turned off, shall not prevent the transfer of such information to emergency services for the purposes of facilitating access to such services . directive 2014/53/eu empowers the commission to adopt delegated acts requiring that specific categories or classes of radio equipment support certain features ensuring access to emergency services. 7820/18 km/ek 31 annex dge2b en (29) technology exists that enables providers of electronic communications services to limit the reception of unwanted, malicious or nuisance calls by end -users in different ways, including blocking silent calls and other fraudulent unwanted, malicious and nuis ance calls , such as calls originating from invalid numbers, i.e. numbers that do not exist in the numbering plan, valid numbers that are not allocated to a provider of a number -based interpersonal communications service, and valid numbers that are allocate d but not assigned to an end -user . providers of publicly available number -based interpersonal communications services should deploy this technology and protect end -users against nuisance such calls and free of charge. providers should ensure that end -users are aware of the existence of such functionalities, for instance, by publicising the fact on their webpage. (30) publicly available directories of end -users of electronic communications services are widely distributed. publicly available directories means any directory or service containing categories of information on end -users information personal data of number -based interpersonal communication services such as name, phone numbers (including mobile phone numbers), email address contact details , home add ress and includes inquiry services, the main function of which is to enable to identify such end -users . the right to privacy and to protection of the personal data of a natural person requires that end -users that are natural persons are asked for consent b efore their personal data are included in a directory able to determine per category of personal data whether their personal data are included in a directory . the legitimate interest of legal entities persons requires that end -users that are legal entities persons have the right to object to the data related to them being included in a directory. end -users who are natural persons acting in a professional capacity should be treated as legal persons for the purpose of the provisions on publicly available direc tories . 7820/18 km/ek 32 annex dge2b en (31) if end -users that are natural persons give their consent to their data being included in such directories, they should be able to determine on a consent basis which categories of personal data are included in the directory (for example name, email address, home address, user name, phone number). in addition, p providers of publicly available directories number -based interpersonal communications services and/or providers of publicly available directories should inform the end -users who are nat ural persons of the purposes of the directory and of the search functions of the directory and obtain their additional consent before including them in that directory enabling such search functions related to their personal data . end -users should be able to determine by consent on the basis of which categories of personal data their contact details can be searched. the categories of personal data included in the directory and the categories of personal data on the basis of which the end -user's contact detail s can be searched should not necessarily be the same. (31a) for the purposes of the provisions relating to direct marketing communications, electronic message should include e -mail, sms, mms and functionally equivalent applications and techniques. (32) in this regulation, direct marketing communications refers to any form of advertising by which a natural or legal person sends or presents direct marketing communications directly to one or more identified or identifiable end -users using electronic communi cations services. the provisions on direct marketing communications do not apply to any other form of marketing, e.g. displaying advertising to the general public on a website which is not directed to any specific identified or identifiable end -user. in ad dition to the offering of products and services for commercial purposes, this should direct marketing communications also may include messages sent by political parties that contact natural persons via electronic communications services in order to promote their parties. the same should appl yies to messages sent by other non -profit organisations to support the purposes of the organisation. 7820/18 km/ek 33 annex dge2b en (33) safeguards should be provided to protect end -users against unsolicited direct marketing communications for direc t marketing purposes , which intrude into the private life privacy of end -users. the degree of privacy intrusion and nuisance is considered relatively similar independently of the wide range of technologies and channels used to conduct these electronic comm unications, whether using automated calling and communication systems , instant messaging applications, emails, sms, mms, bluetooth, etc. it is therefore justified to require that consent of the end -user s who are natural persons is obtained before commercia l electronic communications for direct marketing communications purposes are sent or presented to end -users them in order to effectively protect individuals them against the intrusion into their private life as well as the legitimate interest of legal pers ons. legal certainty and the need to ensure that the rules protecting against unsolicited electronic direct marketing communications remain future -proof justify the need to define in principle a single set of rules that do not vary according to the technology used to convey these unsolicited direct marketing communications, while at the same time guaranteeing an equivalent level of protection for all citizens throughout the union. however, it i s reasonable to allow the use of e-mail contact details for electronic message within the context of an existing customer relationship for the offering of similar products or services. such possibility should only apply to the same company that has obtaine d the electronic contact details for electronic message in accordance with regulation (eu) 2016/679. (3633a)voice -to-voice direct marketing calls that do not involve the use of automated calling and communication systems , given that they are more costly fo r the sender and impose no financial costs on end -users. member states should therefore be able to establish and or maintain national systems only allowing such calls to end -users who are natural persons and who have not objected. 7820/18 km/ek 34 annex dge2b en (34) when end -users who are natural persons have provided their consent to receiving unsolicited direct marketing communications for direct marketing purposes , they should still be able to withdraw their consent at any time in an easy manner and without any cost to them . to faci litate effective enforcement of union rules on unsolicited messages for direct marketing communications , it is necessary to prohibit the masking of the identity and the use of false identities, false return addresses or numbers while sending or presenting unsolicited commercial direct marketing communications for direct marketing purposes . unsolicited direct marketing communications should therefore be clearly recognizable as such and should indicate the identity of the legal or the natural person transmitt ing sending or presenting the communication or on behalf of whom the communication is transmitted sent or presented and provide the necessary information for recipients end -users who are natural persons to exercise their right to oppose withdraw their consent to receiving further written and/or oral marketing messages direct marketing communications, such as valid contact details (e.g. link, e -mail address) which can be easily used by end -users who are natural persons to withdraw their consent free of c harge . (35) in order to allow easy withdrawal of consent, legal or natural persons conducting direct marketing communications by email should present a link, or a valid electronic mail address, which can be easily used by end -users to withdraw their conse nt. legal or natural persons conducting direct marketing communications through voice -to-voice calls and through calls by automating calling and communication systems should display present their identity line on which the company can be called . member sta tes are encouraged to introduce by means of national law or present a specific code or prefix identifying the fact that the call is a direct marketing call to improve the tools provided for the end -users in order to protect their privacy in more efficient manner . using a specific code or prefix should not relieve the legal or natural persons sending or presenting direct marketing call from the obligation to present their calling line identification. 7820/18 km/ek 35 annex dge2b en (37) service providers who offer electronic communica tions services should inform end - users of measures they can take to protect the security of their communications for instance by using specific types of software or encryption technologies. the requirement to inform end -users of particular security risks does not discharge a service provider from the obligation to take, at its own costs, appropriate and immediate measures to remedy any new, unforeseen security risks and restore the normal security level of the service. the provision of information about se curity risks to the subscriber should be free of charge. security is appraised in the light of article 32 of regulation (eu) 2016/679 . \u2013 7820/18 km/ek 36 annex dge2b en chapter i general provisions article 1 subject matter 1. this regulation lays down rules regarding the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural and legal persons in the provision and use of electronic communications services, and in particular, the rights to respect for private life and communica tions and the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. 1a. this regulation lays down rules regarding the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of legal persons in the provision and use of the electronic com munications services, and in particular their rights to respect of communications. 2. this regulation ensures the free movement of electronic communications data and electronic communications services within the union , which shall be neither restricted n or prohibited for reasons related to the respect for the private life and communications of natural and legal persons and the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data , and for protection of communications of legal person s. 3. the provisions of this regulation particularise and complement regulation (eu) 2016/679 with regard to the processing of electronic communications data that qualify as personal data by laying down specific rules for the purposes mentioned in paragra phs 1 and to 2. 7820/18 km/ek 37 annex dge2b en article 2 material scope 1. this regulation applies to : (a) the processing of electronic communications content data in transmission and of electronic communications metadata carried out in connection with the provision and the use of electronic communications services ; and to (b) information related to processed by or emitted by or stored in the terminal equipment of end -users.
