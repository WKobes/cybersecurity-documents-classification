(2) article 88 of the treaty on the functioning of the european uni on (tfeu) provides for europol to be governed by a regulatio n to be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. it also requires the establishment of procedures for the scrutiny of europol\u2122s activities by the european parliament , together with national parliaments, subject to point (c) of article 12 of the treaty on european uni on (teu) and article 9 of protocol no 1 on the role of national parliaments in the european uni on, annexed to the teu and to the tfeu ( \u201aprotocol no 1\u2122), in order to enhance the democratic legitimacy and accountability of europol to the union \u2122s citizens. therefore, decision 2009/371/jha should be replaced by a regulation laying down, inter alia, rules on parliamentary scrutiny. 1 council decision 2009/371/jha of 6 april 2009 establishing the european police office (europol) (oj l 121, 15.05.2009, p. 37). 2 oj c 316, 27.11.1995, p. 1. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 3 dgd 1 en (3) the \u201astockholm progra mme \u0153 an open and secure europe serving and protecting citizens\u2122 1 calls for europol to evolve and become a hub for information exchange between the law enforcement authorities of the member state s, a service provider and a platform for law enforcement serv ices. on the basis of an assessment of europol\u2122s functioning, further enhancement of its operational effectiveness is needed to meet that objective. (4) large -scale criminal and terrorist networks pose a significant threat to the internal security of the union and to the safety and livelihood of its citizens. available threat assessments show that criminal groups are becoming increasingly poly -criminal and cross -border in their activities. national law enforcement authorities therefore need to cooperate mo re closely with their counterparts in other member state s. in this context, it is necessary to equip europol to better support member state s in union -wide crime prevention, analyses and investigations. this was also confirmed in the evaluation of decision 2009/371/jha. 1 oj c 115, 4.5.2010, p. 1. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 4 dgd 1 en (5) this regulation aims to amend and expand the provisions of decision 2009/371/jha and of council decisions 2009/934/jha 1, 2009/935/jha 2, 2009/936/jha 3 and 2009/968/jha 4 implementing decision 2009/371/jha. since the amendments to be made a re of a substantial number and nature, those decisions should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced in their entirety in relation to the member state s bound by this regulation. europol as established by this regulation should replace and assume the fun ctions of europol as established by decision 2009/371/jha, which, as a consequence, should be repealed. 1 council decision 2009/934/jha of 30 november 2009 adopting the implementing rules governing europol\u2122s relations with partners, including the exchange of pers onal data and classified information (oj l 325, 11.12.2009, p. 6). 2 council decision 2009/935/jha of 30 november 2009 determining the list of third states and organisations with which europol shall conclude agreements (oj l 325, 11.12.2009, p. 12). 3 coun cil decision 2009/936/jha of 30 november 2009 adopting the implementing rules for europol analysis work files (oj l 325, 11.12.2009, p. 14). 4 council decision 2009/968/jha of 30 november 2009 adopting the rules on the confidentiality of europol informatio n (oj l 332, 17.12.2009, p. 17). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 5 dgd 1 en (6) as serious crime often occurs across internal borders, europol should support and strengthen member state s\u2122 actions and their cooperation in preven ting and combating serious crime affecting two or more member state s. given that terrorism is one of the most significant threats to the security of the union, europol should assist member state s in facing common challenges in this regard. as the union law enforcement agency, europol should also support and strengthen actions and cooperation in tackling forms of crime that affect the interests of the union. among the forms of crime with which europol is competent to deal, organised crime will continue to fa ll within the scope of europol\u2122s main objectives, as, given its scale, significance and consequences, it also calls for a common approach by the member state s. europol should also offer support in preventing and combating related criminal offences which are committed in order to procure the means of perpetrating acts in respect of which europol is competent or to facilitate or perpetrate such acts or to ensure the impunity of committing them . 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 6 dgd 1 en (7) europol should provide strategic analyses and threat asses sments to assist the council and the commission in laying down strategic and operational priorities of the union for fighting crime and in the operational implementation of those priorities. where the commission so requests in accordance with article 8 of council regulation (eu) no 1053/2013 1, europol should also carry out risk analyses, including in respect of organised crime , in so far as the risks concerned may undermine the application of the schengen acquis by the member state s. moreover, at the reques t of the council or the commission where appropriate, europol should provide strategic analyses and threat assessments to contribute to the evaluation of states that are candidates for accession to the union. (8) attacks against information systems affecti ng union bodies or two or more member state s are a growing menace in the union, in particular in view of their speed and impact and the difficulty in identifying their sources. when considering requests by europol to initiate an investigation into a seriou s attack of suspected criminal origin against information systems affecting union bodies or two or more member state s, member state s should respond to europol without delay, taking into account the fact that the rapidity of the response is a key factor in successfully tackling computer crime. 1 council regulation (eu) no 1053/2013 of 7 october 2013 establishing an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the schengen acquis and repealing the decision of the executive committee of 16 septe mber 1998 setting up a standing committee on the evaluation and implementation of schengen (oj l 295, 6.11.2013, p. 27). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 7 dgd 1 en (9) given the importance of the inter -agency cooperation, europol and eurojust should ensure that necessary arrangements are established to optimise their operational cooperation, taking due account of their respectiv e missions and mandates and of the interests of member state s. in particular, europol and eurojust should keep each other informed of any activity involving the financing of joint investigation teams. (10) when a joint investigation team is set up, the rel evant agreement should determine the conditions relating to the participation of the europol staff in the team. europol should keep a record of its participation in such joint investigation teams targeting criminal activities falling within the scope of its objectives. (11) europol should be able to request member state s to initiate, conduct or coordinate criminal investigations in specific cases where cross -border cooperation would add value. europol should inform eurojust of such requests. (12) europol sh ould be a hub for information exchange in the union. information collected, stored, processed, analysed and exchanged by europol includes criminal intelligence which relates to information about crime or criminal activities falling within the scope of euro pol\u2122s objectives, obtained with a view to establishing whether concrete criminal acts have been committed or may be committed in the future . 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 8 dgd 1 en (13) in order to ensure europol \u2122s effectiveness as a hub for information exchange, clear obligations should be laid down requiring member state s to provide europol with the data necessary for it to fulfil its objectives. while implementing such obligations, member state s should pay particular attention to providing data relevant to the fight against crime s considered to be strategic and operational priorities within relevant policy instruments of the union, in particular the priorities set by the council in the framework of the eu policy cycle for organised and serious international crime. member state s should also endeavour to provide europol with a copy of bilateral and multilateral exchanges of information with other member state s on crime falling within europol \u2122s objectives. when supplying europol with the necessary information, member state s should als o include information about any alleged cyber attacks affecting union bodies located in their territory. at the same time, europol should increase the level of its support to member state s, so as to enhance mutual cooperation and the sharing of information . europol should submit an annual report to the european parliament , to the council, to the commission and to national parliaments on the information provided by the individual member state s. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 9 dgd 1 en (14) to ensure effective cooperation between europol and member state s, a national unit should be set up in each member state (the \u201anational unit \u2122). the national unit should be the liaison link between national competent authorities and europol, thereby having a coordinating role in respect of member state s\u2122 cooperati on with europol, and thus helping to ensure that each member state responds to europol requests in a uniform way. to ensure a continuous and effective exchange of information between europol and the national units, and to facilitate their cooperation, each national unit should designate at least one liaison officer to be attached to europol. (15) taking into account the decentralised structure of some member state s and the need to ensure rapid exchanges of information, europol should be allowed to cooperate directly with competent authorities in member state s, subject to the conditions defined by member state s, while keeping the national units informed at the latte r\u2122s request . (16) the establishment of joint investigation teams should be encouraged and europol staff should be able to participate in them. to ensure that such participation is possible in every member state , council regulation (euratom, ecsc, eec) no 549/69 1 provides that europol staff do not benefit from immunities while they are participating in joint investigation teams. (17) it is also necessary to improve the governance of europol, by seeking efficiency gains and streamlining procedures. 1 regulation (euratom, ecsc, eec) no 549/69 of the council of 25 march 1969 determining the categories of officials and other servants of the european communities to whom the provisions of article 12, the second paragraph of article 13 and article 14 of the protocol on the privileges and immunities of the communities apply (oj l 74, 27.3.1969, p. 1). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 10 dgd 1 en (18) the commission and the member state s should be represented on the management board of europol (the \u201amanagement board \u2122) to effectively supervise its work. the members and the alternate members of the management board should be appointed taking into account thei r relevant managerial, administrative and budgetary skills and knowledge of law enforcement cooperation. alternate members should act as members in the absence of the member. (19) all parties represented on the management board should make efforts to limit the turnover of their representatives, with a view to ensuring the continuity of the management board\u2122s work. all parties should aim to achieve a balanced representation between men and women on the management board. (20) the management board should be ab le to invite non -voting observers whose opinion may be relevant for the discussion, including a representative designated by the joint parliamentary scrutiny group (jpsg). (21) the management board should be given the necessary powers, in particular to set the budget, verify its execution, and adopt the appropriate financial rules and planning documents, as well as adopt rules for the prevention and management of conflicts of interest in respect of its members, establish transparent working procedures for decision -making by the executive director of europol, and adopt the annual activity report. it should exercise the powers of appointing authority vis -\u00e0-vis staff of the agency, including the executive director. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 11 dgd 1 en (22) to ensure the efficient day -to-day funct ioning of europol, the executive director should be its legal representative and manager, acting independently in the performance of his or her duties and ensuring that europol carries out the tasks provided for by this regulation. in particular, the execu tive director should be responsible for preparing budgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the management board and for implementing the multi -annual programming and annual work programmes of europol and other planning documents. (23) for the purposes of preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of its objectives, it is necessary for europol to have the fullest and most up -to-date information possible. therefore, europol should be able to process data provided to it by member state s, union bodies, third countries, international organisations and, under stringent conditions laid down by this regulation, private parties, as well as data coming from publicly available sources, in order to develop an understanding of criminal phenomena and trends, to gather information about criminal networks, and to detect links between different criminal offences. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 12 dgd 1 en (24) to improve europol\u2122s effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses to the competent authorities of the member state s, it should use new technologies to process data. europol should be able to swiftly detect links between investigations and common modi operandi across different criminal groups, to check cross -matches of data and to have a clear overview of trends, while gu aranteeing a high level of protection of personal data for individuals. therefore, europol databases should be structured in such a way as to allow europol to choose the most efficient it structure. europol should also be able to act as a service provider, in particular by providing a secure network for the exchange of data , such as the secure information exchange network application ( siena), aimed at facilitating the exchange of information between member state s, europol, other union bodies, third countrie s and international organisations. in order to ensure a high level of data protection, the purpose of processing operations and access rights as well as specific additional safeguards should be laid down. in particular, the principles of necessity and prop ortionality should be observed with regard to the processing of personal data. (25) europol should ensure that all personal data processed for operational analyses are allocated a specific purpose. nonetheless, in order for europol to fulfil its mission, i t should be allowed to process all personal data received to identify links between multiple crime areas and investigations, and should not be limited to identifying connections only within one crime area. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 13 dgd 1 en (26) to respect the ownership of data and the pro tection of personal data , member state s, union bodies, third countries and international organisations should be able to determine the purpose or purposes for which europol may process the data they provide and to restrict access rights. purpose limitation is a fundamental principle of personal data processing; in particular, it contributes to transparency, legal certainty and predictability and is particularly of high importance in the area of law enforcement cooperation, where data subjects are usually un aware when their personal data are being collected and processed and where the use of personal data may have a very significant impact on the lives and freedoms of individuals. (27) to ensure that data are accessed only by those needing access in order to perform their tasks, this regulation should lay down detailed rules on different degrees of right of access to data processed by europol. such rules should be without prejudice to restrictions on access imposed by data providers, as the principle of owners hip of data should be respected. in order to increase efficiency in the prevention and combating of crimes falling within the scope of europol\u2122s objectives, europol should notify member state s of information which concerns them. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 14 dgd 1 en (28) to enhance operationa l cooperation between the agencies, and particularly to establish links between data already in the possession of the different agencies, europol should enable eurojust and the european anti -fraud office (olaf) to have access, on the basis of a hit/no hit system, to data available at europol. europol and eurojust should be able to conclude a working arrangement ensuring, in a reciprocal manner within their respective mandates, access to , and the possibility of searching, all information that has been provid ed for the purpose of cross -checking in accordance with specific safeguards and data protection guarantees provided for in this regulation. any access to data available at europol should , by technical means , be limited to information falling within the res pective mandates of those union bodies. (29) europol should maintain cooperative relations with other union bodies, authorities of third countries, international organisations and private parties, to the extent required for the accomplishment of its tasks. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 15 dgd 1 en (30) to ensure operational effectiveness, europol should be able to exchange all relevant information, with the exception of personal data, with other union bodies, authorities of third countries and international organisations, to the extent necessary for the performance of its tasks. since companies, firms, business associations, non -governmental organisations and other private parties hold expertise and information of direct relevance to the prevention and combating of serious crime and terrorism, europol should also be able to exchange such information with private parties. to preven t and combat cybercrime, as related to network and information security incidents, europol should, pursuant to the applicable legisl ati ve act of the union laying down measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the uni on, cooperate and exchange information, with the exception of personal data, with national authorities competent for the security of network and information systems. (31) europol should be able to exchange relevant personal data with other union bodies to the extent necessary for the accomplishment of its or their tasks. (32) serious crime and terrorism often have links beyond the territory of the union. europol should therefore be able to exchange personal data with authorities of third countries and with international organisations such as the international criminal police organisation \u0153 interpol to the extent necessary for the accomplishment of its tasks. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 16 dgd 1 en (33) all member state s are affiliated to interpol. to fulfil its mission, interpol receives, stores and circulates data to assist competent law enforcement authorities to prevent and combat international crime. therefore, it is appropriate to strengthen cooperation between europol and interpol by promoting an efficient exchange of personal data whilst en suring respect for fundamental rights and freedoms regarding the automatic processing of personal data. when personal data is transferred from europol to interpol, this regulation, in particular the provisions on international transfers, should apply. (34) to guarantee purpose limitation, it is important to ensure that personal data can be transferred by europol to union bodies, third countries and international organisations only if necessary for preventing and combating crime that falls within europol \u2122s objectives. to this end, it is necessary to ensure that, when personal data are transferred , the recipient gives an undertaking that the data will be used by the recipient or transferred onward to a competent authority of a third country solely for the purp ose for which they were originally transferred. further onward transfer of the data should take place in compliance with this regulation. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 17 dgd 1 en (35) europol should be able to transfer personal data to an authority of a third country or an international organisa tion on the basis of a commission decision finding that the country or international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of data protection (\u201aadequacy decision \u2122), or, in the absence of an adequacy decision, an international agreement conclud ed by the union pursuant to article 218 tfeu, or a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data concluded between europol and the third country prior to the entry into force of this regulation. in light of article 9 of protocol no 36 on transitional provisions, annexed to the teu and to the tfeu, the legal effects of such agreements are to be preserved until those agreements are repealed, annulled or amended in the implementation of the treat ies . where appropriate and in accordance with regulation (ec) no 45/2001 of the european parliament and of the council 1, the commission should be able to consult the european data protection supervisor (edps) before and during the negotiation of an international agreement. where the management board identifies an operational need for cooperation with a third country or an international organisation, it shou ld be able to suggest to the council that the latter draw the attention of the commission to the need for an adequacy decision or for a recommendation for the opening of negotiations on an international agreement as referred to above. 1 regulation (ec) no 45/2001 of the eu ropean parliament and of the council of 18 december 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (oj l 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 18 dgd 1 en (36) where a transfe r of personal data cannot be based on an adequacy decision, an international agreement concluded by the union or an existing cooperation agreement, the management board , in agreement with the edps , should be allowed to authorise a set of transfers, where s pecific conditions so require and provided that adequate safeguards are ensured. the executive director should be allowed to authorise the transfer of data in exceptional cases on a case -by-case basis, where such transfer is required, under specific strict conditions . (37) europol should be able to process personal data originating from private parties and private persons only if those data are transferred to europol by one of the following: a national unit in accordance with its national law; a contact poi nt in a third country or an international organisation with which there is established cooperation through a cooperation agreement allowing for the exchange of personal data concluded in accordance with article 23 of decision 2009/371/jha prior to the entr y into force of this regulation; an authority of a third country or an international organisation which is subject to an adequacy decision or with which the union has concluded an international agreement pursuant to article 218 tfeu. however, in cases wher e europol receives personal data directly from private parties and the national unit, contact point or authority concerned cannot be identified, europol should be able to process those personal data solely for the purpose of identifying those entities, and such data should be deleted unless those entities resubmit those personal data within four months after the transfer takes place. europol should ensure by technical means that , during that period , such data would not be accessible for processing for any o ther purpose. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 19 dgd 1 en (38) taking into account the exceptional and specific threat posed to the internal security of the union by terrorism and other forms of serious crime, especially when facilitated, promoted or committed using the internet, the activities tha t europol should undertake on the basis of this regulation, stemming from its implementation of the council conclusions of 12 march 2015 and the call by the european council of 23 april 2015 in relation especially to those priority areas , in particular the corresponding practice of direct exchanges of personal data with private parties, should be evaluated by the commission by 1 may 2019. (39) any information which has clearly been obtained in obvious violation of human rights should not be processed. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 20 dgd 1 en (40) data protection rules at europol should be strengthened and should draw on the principles underpinning regulation (ec) no 45/2001 to ensure a high level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. as declaration no 21 on the protection of personal data in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation , attached to the teu and the tfeu , recogni ses the specificity of personal data processing in the law enforcement context, the data protection ru les of europol should be autonomous while at the same time consistent with other relevant data protection instruments applicable in the area of police cooperation in the union. those instruments include, in particular, the applicable legislative act of the union on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the fre e movement of such data, as well as the convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data of the council of europe and its recommendation no . r(87) 151. 1 council of europe committee of ministers recommendation no. r(87) 15 to the member states on regulating the use of personal data in the police sector, 17.9.1987. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 21 dgd 1 en (41) any processing of personal data by europol should be lawful and fair in relation to the data subjects concerned. the principle of fair processing requires transparency of processing allowing data subjects concerned to exercise their rights under this regulation. it should be possible nevertheless to refu se or restrict access to their personal data if, with due regard to the interests of the data subjects concerned, such refusal or restriction constitutes a necessary measure to enable europol to fulfil its tasks properly, to protect security and public ord er or to prevent crime, to guarantee that a national investigation will not be jeopardised or to protect the rights and freedoms of third parties. to enhance transparency, europol should make publicly available a document setting out in an intelligible for m the applicable provisions regarding the processing of personal data and the means available to data subjects to exercise their rights. europol should also publish on its website a list of adequacy decisions, agreements and administrative arrangements rel ating to the transfer of personal data to third countries and international organisations. moreover, in order to increase europol \u2122s transparency vis -\u00e0-vis union citizens and its accountability, europol should publish on its website a list of its management board members and , where appropriate, the summaries of the outcome of the meetings of the management board, while respecting data protection requirements. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 22 dgd 1 en (42) as far as possible, personal data should be distinguished according to their degree of accurac y and reliability. facts should be distinguished from personal assessments, in order to ensure both the protection of individuals and the quality and reliability of the information processed by europol. in the case of information obtained from publicly ava ilable sources, particularly sources on the internet , europol should as far as possible assess the accuracy of such information and the reliability of its source with particular diligence in order to address the risks associated with the internet as regard s the protection of personal data and privacy. (43) personal data relating to different categories of data subjects are processed in the area of law enforcement cooperation. europol should make distinctions between personal data in respect of different cat egories of data subjects as clear as possible. personal data concerning persons such as victims, witnesses and persons possessing relevant information, as well as personal data concerning minors, should in particular be protected. europol should only proce ss sensitive data if those data supplement other personal data already processed by europol. (44) in the light of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, europol should not store personal data for longer than is necessary for the performa nce of its tasks. the need for continued storage of such data should be reviewed no later than three years after the start of its initial processing. (45) to guarantee the security of personal data, europol and member state s should implement necessary tech nical and organisational measures. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 23 dgd 1 en (46) any data subject should have a right of access to personal data concerning him or her , a right to rectification if those data are inaccurate , and a right to eras ure or restriction if those data are no longer require d. the costs related to exercising the right of access to personal data should not represent a barrier to effectively exercising that right. the rights of the data subject and the exercise thereof should not affect the obligations incumbent upon europol and should be subject to the restrictions laid down in this regulation. (47) the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects requires a clear attribution of the responsibilities under this regulation. in particular, member state s should be responsible for the accuracy of data, for keeping up to date the data they have transferred to europol and for the legality of such data transfers. europol should be responsible for the accuracy of data and for keeping up to date the data provi ded by other data suppliers or resulting from europol \u2122s own analyses. europol should ensure that data are processed fairly and lawfully, and are collected and processed for a specific purpose. europol should also ensure that the data are adequate, relevant , not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are processed, stored no longer than is necessary for that purpose, and processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data and confidentiality of data processing. (48) europol should keep records of collection, alteration, access, disclosure, combination or erasure of personal data for the purposes of verifying the lawfulness of the data processing, self -monitoring and ensuring proper data integrity and security. europol should be obliged to co -operate with the edps and to make logs or documentation available upon request, so that they can be used for monitoring processing operations. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 24 dgd 1 en (49) europol should designate a data protection officer to assist it in monitoring compliance with this regulation. the data protection officer should be in a position to perform his or her duties and tasks independently and effectively , and should be provided with the necessary resources to do so. (50) independent, transparent, accountable and effe ctive structures for supervision are essential for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data as required by article 8(3) of the charter of fundamental rights of the european uni on. national authorities competent for the s upervision of the processing of personal data should monitor the lawfulness of personal data provided by member state s to europol. the edps should monitor the lawfulness of data processing carried out by europol , exercising his or her functions with comple te independence. in this regard, the prior consultation mechanism is an important safeguard for new types of processing operations. this should not apply to specific individual operational activities, such as operational analysis projects, but to the use o f new it systems for the processing of personal data and any substantial changes thereto. (51) it is important to ensure strengthened and effective supervision of europol and to guarantee that the edps can make use of appropriate law enforcement data prote ction expertise when he or she assumes responsibility for data protection supervision of europol. the edps and national supervisory authorities should closely cooperate with each other on specific issues requiring national involvement and should ensure the consistent application of this regulation throughout the union. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 25 dgd 1 en (52) in order to facilitate the cooperation between the edps and the national supervisory authorities, but without prejudice to the independence of the edps and his or her responsibility for data protection supervision of europol, they should regularly meet within the cooperation board , which, as an advisory body, should deliver opinions, guidelines, recommendations and best practices on various issues requiring national in volvement. (53) as europol also processes non-operational personal data, unrelated to criminal investigations, such as personal data concerning staff of europol, service providers or visitors, the processing of such data should be subject to regulation (ec) no 45/2001. (54) the edps should hear and investigate complaints lodged by data subjects. the investigation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case. the national s upervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. (55) any individual should have the right to a judicial remedy against a decision of the edps concerning him or her. (56) europ ol should be subject to the general rules on contractual and non -contractual liability applicable to union institutions, agencies and bodies, save as regards the rules on liability for unlawful data processing. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 26 dgd 1 en (57) it may be unclear for the individual co ncerned whether damage suffered as a result of unlawful data processing is a consequence of action by europol or by a member state . europol and the member state in which the event that gave rise to the damage occurred should therefore be jointly and severa lly liable. (58) while respecting the role of the european parliament together with national parliaments in the scrutiny of europol \u2122s activities, it is necessary that europol be a fully accountable and transparent internal organisation. to that end, in lig ht of article 88 tfeu, procedures should be established for the scrutiny of europol \u2122s activities by the european parliament together with national parliaments. such procedures should be subject to point (c) of article 12 teu and to article 9 of protocol no 1, providing that the european parliament and national parliaments are together to determine the organisation and promotion of effective and regular interparliamentary cooperation within the union. the procedures to be established for the scrutiny of euro pol\u2122s activities should take due account of the need to ensure that the european parliament and the national parliaments stand on an equal footing, as well as the need to safeguard the confidentiality of operational information. however, the way in which national parliaments scrutinise their governments in relation to the activities of the union is a matter for the particular constitutional organisation and practice of each member state . 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 27 dgd 1 en (59) the staff regulations of officials of the european uni on (the \u2122staff regulations \u2122) and the conditions of employment of other servants of the european uni on (the \u201aconditions of employment of other servants \u2122) laid down in council regulation (eec, eura tom, ecsc) no 259/68 1 should apply to europol staff. europol should be able to employ staff from the competent authorities of the member state s as temporary agents whose period of service should be limited in order to maintain the principle of rotation, as the subsequent reintegration of such staff members into the service of their competent authority facilitates close cooperation between europol and the competent authorities of the member state s. member state s should take any measure necessary to ensure th at staff engaged at europol as temporary agents may, at the end of their term of service at europol, return to the national civil service to which they belong. (60) given the nature of the duties of europol and the role of the executive director, the compe tent committee of the european parliament should be able to invite the executive director to appear before it prior to his or her appointment, as well as prior to any extension of his or her term of office. the executive director should also present the annual report to the european parliament and to the council. furthermore, the european parliament and the council should be able to invite the executive director to report on the performance of his or her duties. 1 oj l 56, 4.3.1968, p. 1. 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 28 dgd 1 en (61) to guarantee the full autonomy and inde pendence of europol, it should be granted an autonomous budget, with revenue coming essentially from a contribution from the general budget of the union. the union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the union contribution and any other subs idies chargeable to the general budget of the union are concerned. the auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the court of auditors. (62) commission delegated regulation (eu) no 1271/2013 1 should apply to europol. (63) given their specific legal and administrative powers and their technical competences in conducting cross -border information -exchange activities, operations and investigations, including in joint investigation teams, and in providing facilities for training, the competent authorities of the member state s should be able to receive grants from europol without a call for proposals in accordance with point (d) of article 190(1) of commission delegated regulation (eu) no 1268/2012 2. (64) regulation (eu , euratom ) no 883/2013 of the european parliament and of the council 3 should apply to europol. 1 commission delegated regulation (eu) no 1271/2013 of 30 september 2013 on the framework financial regulation for the bodies referred to in article 208 of regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012 of the european parliament and of the council (oj l 328, 7.12.2013, p. 42). 2 commission delegated regulation (eu) no 1268/2012 of 29 octob er 2012 on the rules of application of regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012 of the european parliament and of the council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the union ( oj l 362, 31.12.2012, p. 1). 3 regulation (eu, euratom) no 883/2 013 of the european parliament and of the council of 11 september 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the european anti -fraud office (olaf) and repealing regulation (ec) no 1073/1999 of the european parliament and of the council and council regulat ion (euratom) no 1074/1999 (oj l 248, 18.9.2013, p. 1). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 29 dgd 1 en (65) europol processes data that require particular protection as they include sensitive non-classified and eu classified information. europol should therefore draw up rules on the confident iality and processing of such information. the rules on the protection of eu classified information should be consistent with council decision 2013/488/eu 1. (66) it is appropriate to evaluate the application of this regulation regularly. (67) the necessary provisions regarding accommodation for europol in the hague, where it has its headquarters, and the specific rules applicable to all europol\u2122s staff and members of their families should be laid down in a headquarters agreement. furthermore, the host membe r state should provide the necessary conditions for the smooth operation of europol, including multilingual, european -oriented schooling and appropriate transport connections, so as to attract high -quality human resources from as wide a geographical area a s possible. (68) europol as established by this regulation replaces and succeeds europol as established by decision 2009/371/jha. it should therefore be the legal successor of all its contracts, including employment contracts, liabilities and properties ac quired. international agreements concluded by europol as established by decision 2009/371/jha and agreements concluded by europol as established by the europol convention before 1 january 2010 should remain in force. 1 council decision 2013/488/eu of 23 september 2013 on the security rules for protecting eu classified information (oj l 274, 15.10.2013, p. 1). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 30 dgd 1 en (69) to enable europol to continue to fulfil the tasks of europol as established by decision 2009/371/jha to the best of its abilities, transitional measures should be laid down, in particular with regard to the management board, the executive director and staff employed under a contract of in definite duration as a local staff member concluded by europol as established by the europol convention , who should be offered the possibility of employment as a member of the temporary or contract staff under the conditions of employment of other servants . (70) council act 1999/c 26/07 1 on europol staff regulations has been repealed by article 63 of decision 2009/371/jha. however, it should continue to apply to staff employed by europol before the entry into force of decision 2009/371/jha. therefore, trans itional provisions should provide that contracts concluded in accordance with those staff regulations are to remain governed by them. (71) since the objective of this regulation, namely the establishment of an entity responsible for law enforcement coopera tion at union level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member state s but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at union level, the union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 teu. in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article, this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 1 council act 1999/c 26/07 of 3 december 1998 laying do wn the staff regulations applicable to europol employees (oj c 26, 30.1.1999, p. 23). 14957/2/15 rev 2 dsi/fc/vm 31 dgd 1 en (72) in accordance with article 3 and article 4a(1) of protocol no 21 on the position of the united kingdom and ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the teu and to the tfeu, ireland has notified its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this regulation.
