general approach i. introduction on 30 november 2016, the commission adopted and transmitted to the council and to the european parliament the above -mentioned recast proposal which focuses especially on consumers' rights and the importance of a well -functioning internal market, including general principles member states will have to apply to ensure that the eu electricity marke t is competitive, consumer -cent red, flexible and non -discriminatory. the 'cl ean energy for all europeans' package was presented at the meeting of the tte (energy) council in december 2016. at the meeting of the tte (energy) council in february 2017, a first exchange of views on the package was held. 14572/17 gw/ns 2 dge 2b en after the examination of the impact assessments of all eight legislative proposals was completed and the detailed examination of the proposals had started, the tte (energy) council in june 2017 took note of a progress report 1. the european parliament's itre committee appointed arturs krisjanis karins (epp) as rapporteur and is expected to adopt its opinion in december 2017. ii. work within the coun cil preparatory bodi es following the above progress report on the state of play, presented by the maltese pres idency, the working party has under the estonian presidency continued to examine the proposal on several occasions throughout the months of july - november 2017. the discussion at the level of the working party was intense and revealed different views and priorities among member states on several aspects of the proposal. accordingly, the presidency worked intensively to find comprom ise solutions to accommodate various concerns raised by delegations in order to strike a proper balance in the text, with the v iew to reaching a general approach at the tte (energy) council on 18 december 2017. revised versions of the draft electricity directive were issued in september (doc.10691/17) and october (doc.10691/1/17 rev 1). all delegations hold general reservation s/scrutiny reservations and continue to analyse in detail various provisions contained in the draft directive. the new presidency compromise text, which reflects the outcome of the examination by the working party on 13 november 2017 and the subsequent written comments received, appears in the annex to this note. the latest changes are marked in bold underline and deletions are marked with [ ]. changes compared to the commission proposal are marked in bold and deletions with []. the recitals have been adapted to reflect the c hanges in the substantive provisions. 1 st 9578/17 14572/17 gw/ns 3 dge 2b en the presidency believes that the compromise text, as set out in the annex, constitutes a well balanced compromise which, in most of the parts, could be broadly accepted by delegations. however, the main issue describ ed below still needs to be further examined and confirmed before an agreement can be reached. the presidency is well aware that there might be other issues of concern to individual delegations and, thus, the above issue is presented without prejudice to th ese particular points of concern or other provisions revised in the compromise text which have not yet been fully addressed. main outstanding issue and presidency compromise proposals: article 5 - market based supply prices the presidency's compromise text proposes to delete the explicit limit for the duration of the public intervention and for the scope of the beneficiaries, reverting for these issues to the general conditions steaming from the rights of the member states to establish public service obligations enumerated under paragraph 3a. this would mean that for the duration and the scope of the beneficiaries member states would rely on the jurisprudence of the court. the additional criteria in paragraph 3b are kept to ensure the coherenc e of the public service obligations with the aims of the directive and to prevent a situation wher applying public service obligations in price regulation would de facto make the directive inapplicable. however, the criteria in article 3a have been adapted to take account of the comments received by the member states. 14572/17 gw/ns 4 dge 2b en iii. conclusion in light of the above, the permanent representatives committee is invited to examine the presidency compromise text as set out in the annex to this note, discuss all outstand ing issues raised by the delegations and reach agreement on them in preparation for the tte (energy) council upcoming agreement on the general approach at its meeting on 18 december 2017. the general approach would establish the council's provisional p osition on this proposal, and form the basis for the preparations for the negotiations with the european parliament. 14572/17 gw/ns 5 annex dge 2b en annex proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on common rules for the internal market in electricity (recast) (text with eea relevance) the european parliament and the council of the european union, having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union, and in particular article 194(2) thereof, having regard to the proposal from the european commission, after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 2, having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions 3, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure , 2 oj c 211, 19.8.2008, p. 23. 3 oj c 172, 5.7.2008, p. 55. 14572/17 gw/ns 6 annex dge 2b en whereas: (1) a number of amendments are to be mad e to directive 2009/72/ec of the european parliament and of the council 4. in the interests of clarity, that directive should be recast. (2) the internal market in electricity, which has been progressively implemented throughout the union since 1999, aims, by organising competitive electricity markets across country borders, to deliver real choice for all consumers of the european union, be they citizens or businesses, new business opportunities, competitive prices, efficient investment signals, higher stand ards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability. (3) directive 2003/54/ec of the european parliament and of the council and directive 2009/72/ec of the european parliament and of the council have made a significant contribution towards the creation of such an internal market in electricity. however, europe's energy system is in the middle of a profound change. the common goal to [] lower the emission of the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market partici pants. at the same time, technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross -border cooperation. there is a need to adapt the union market rules to a new market reality . (4) the energy union framework strategy sets out the v ision of an energy union with citizens at its core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills, participate actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected. 4 directive 2009/72/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 13 july 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing directive 2003/54/ec (oj l 211, 14.8.2009, p. 55). 14572/17 gw/ns 7 annex dge 2b en (5) the comm unication from the commission of 15 july 2015 'delivering a new deal for energy consumers 5' put forward the commission's vision for a retail market that better serves energy consumers, including by better linking wholesale and retail markets. taking advant age of new technology, new and innovative energy service companies should enable all consumers to fully participate in the energy transition, managing their consumption to deliver energy efficient solutions which save them money and contribute to overall reduction of energy consumption. (6) the communication from the commission of 15 july 2015 'launching the public consultation process on a new energy market design' 6 highlighted that the move away from generation in large central power plants towards de -centralized production from renewable energy sources [] requires an adaptation of the current rules of electricity trading and changes to the existing market roles. it underlined needs to organise electricity markets in a more flexible manner and to fully in tegrate all market players \u0153 including renewable energy producers, new energy service providers, energy storage and flexible demand. (7) apart from the new challenges, the directive seeks also to address the persisting obstacles to the completion of the i nternal market in electricity. refined regulatory framework needs to contribute to overcoming the current problems of fragmented national markets which are still often determined by a high degree of regulatory interventions. such interventions have led to obstacles to the sale of electricity on equal terms as well as higher costs in comparison to solutions based on cross -border cooperation and market -based principles. 5 com (2015) 339 final of 15.7.2015. 6 com (2015) 340 final of 15.7.2015. 14572/17 gw/ns 8 annex dge 2b en (8) consumers are essential to achieving the flexibility necessary to adapt the electrici ty system to variable, distributed renewable generation. technological progress in grid management and renewable generation has unlocked many opportunities for consumers, and healthy competition on retail markets will be essential to ensuring the market -driven deployment of innovative new services that cater to the consumers' changing needs and abilities, while increasing system flexibility. by empowering consumers to participate in the energy market more, and participate in new ways, citizens should benefi t from the internal market in electricity and the union's renewable targets should be attained. (8a) this directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union (\u201acharter\u2122). accordingly, this directive should be interpreted and applied in accordance with those rights and principles, in particular the right to protection of personal data guaranteed by article 8 of the charter. it is essential that any processing of personal dat a under this directive be in compliance with regulation (eu) 2016/679. (9) the freedoms which the treaty guarantees the citizens of the union \u0161 inter alia, the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services \u0161 are a chievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers. (10) promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers should be of the utmost imp ortance for member states in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market in electricity. nonetheless, market failure may still persist in peripheral small electricity systems and systems not connect ed with other eu member states, where electricity prices fail to provide the right signal to drive investment, and may therefore require specific solutions to ensure an adequate level of security of electricity supply. 14572/17 gw/ns 9 annex dge 2b en (11) in order to secure competition and the supply of electricity at the most competitive price, member states and national regulatory authorities should facilitate cross -border access for new suppliers of electricity from different energy sources as well as for new providers of power genera tion , storage and demand response. (11a) this directive should ensure that no undue barriers exist for market entry, operation and exit. moreover, it should be clarified that electricity market participants from third countries may have access to the internal electricity market pursuant to union law, including applicable international obligations. at the same time, member states retain competence to take measures in areas not harmonised by this directive and the rest of the relevant union energy acquis . member states may exercise such competence in accordance with the treaties and the applicable international obligations. (12) securing common rules for a true internal market and a broad supply of electricity accessible to all should also be one of the m ain goals of this directive. to that end, undistorted market prices would provide an incentive for cross -border interconnections and for investments in new power generation while leading, in the long term, to price convergence. (13) market prices should gi ve the right incentives for the development of the network and for investing in new electricity generation. (14) different types of market organisation exist in the internal market in electricity. the measures that member states could take in order to ensu re a level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general interest. the commission should be consulted on the compatibility of the measures with the treaty and union law. 14572/17 gw/ns 10 annex dge 2b en (15) member states should maintain a wide discretion to impose public service obligations on electricity undertakings in pursuing objectives of general economic interest. member states should ensure that household customers and, where member states deem it appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent and competitive prices. nevertheless, public service obligations in the form of supply price regulation constitute a fundamentally distortive measure that often leads to the accumu lation of tariff deficits, limitation of consumer choice, poorer incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments, lower standards of service, lower levels of consumer engagement and satisfaction, restriction of competition as well as fewer i nnovative products and services on the market. consequently, member states should apply other policy tools, and in particular targeted social policy measures, to safeguard the affordability of electricity supply to their citizens. interventions in price setting should only be applied [] as public service obligations and subject to specific conditions specified in this directive . a fully liberalised retail electricity market would stimulate price and non -price competition among existing suppliers and incenti vise new market entries therefore improving consumers' choice and satisfaction. 14572/17 gw/ns 11 annex dge 2b en (15a) public service obligations in the form of electricity supply price regulation should be used without overriding the principle of open markets in clearly defined circums tances and beneficiaries and be limited in duration. such circumstances could occur for example when the supply of electricity is severely constrained, causing significantly higher electricity prices than normal, or in the event of market failure where int erventions by national regulatory authorities and competition authorities have proven ineffective. this would disproportionately affect households, and in particular, vulnerable consumers who typically use a higher share of their disposable income on energ y bills, compared to high income consumers. in order to mitigate the distortive effects of public service obligations in the price -setting for supply of electricity, member states applying such interventions should put in place additional measures, includi ng measures preventing distortions to wholesale market price setting. member states should ensure that all beneficiaries of regulated prices are able to fully benefit from the offers of the competitive market when they choose so. to this effect they need to be equipped with smart meters and have access to dynamic electricity price contracts, they should be directly and regularly informed of the offers and savings available on the competitive market, in particular dynamic electricity price contracts, and be provided with assistance to engage with and benefit from market based offers. (16) in order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the union, all measures taken by member states to achieve the objective of this directive shou ld be regularly notified to the commission. the commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high public service standards. 14572/17 gw/ns 12 annex dge 2b en (17) it should be possible for member states to appoint a supplier of last resort. that supplier may be the sales division of a vertically integrated undertaking, which also performs the functions of distribution, provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of this directive. (18) it should be possible for measures implemented by member states to achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include, in par ticular, the provision of adequate economic incentives, using, where appropriate, all existing national and union tools. such tools may include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment. (19) to the extent to which measures taken by member states to fulfil public service obligations constitute state aid under article107(1) of the treaty, there is an obligation under article 108(3) of the treaty to notify them to the commission. (19a) cross \u0153sectorial legislation provides a strong basis for c onsumer protection for a wide range of energy services that exist, and may develop in the future. nevertheless, certain basic contractual rights of customers should be clearly defined. (20) clear and comprehensible information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. the commission has established , after consulting relevant stakeholders including member states, national regulatory authorities, consumer organisations and electricity undertakings an ene rgy consumer checklist providing consumers with practical information about their rights. that checklist should be maintained up to date provided to all consumers and made publicly available. 14572/17 gw/ns 13 annex dge 2b en (21) at present, several factors impede consumers from accessin g, understanding and acting upon the various sources of market information available to them. to that end, the comparability of offers should be improved and barriers to switching minimised to the greatest practicable extent without unduly limiting consume r choice. (22) smaller customers are still being charged a broad range of fees directly or indirectly as a result of switching energy supplier. such fees make calculating the best product or service more difficult and diminish the immediate financial adva ntage of switching. although removing such fees may limit consumer choice by eliminating products based on rewarding consumer loyalty, restricting their use further should improve consumer welfare, consumer engagement and competition in the market. (22a) shorter expected switching times can encourage consumers to search for better energy deals and switch suppliers. the increased deployment of information technology will mean that technical switching should typically be able to be completed within 24 hours on a working day by the year 2025. notwithstanding other steps in the switching process that must be completed before the technical process of switching is initiated, ensuring the technical process of switching can take place within 24 hours by this date will minimise switching times, helping to increase consumer engagement and retail competition. in any case, the total duration of the switching process should not exceed three weeks from the date of the customer notification. 14572/17 gw/ns 14 annex dge 2b en (23) independent comparison t ools including websites are an effective means for smaller customers to assess the merits of different energy offers available on the market. search costs are lower as they no longer need to collect information from individual suppliers and service provide rs. such tools can provide the right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complete and comprehensive. they should aim at including the broadest possible range of available offers, and at covering the ma rket as completely as is feasible so as to give the customer a representative overview. it is crucial that consumers have access to at least one comparison tool and that the information given on such tools be trustworthy, impartial and transparent . member states may provide for this through a comparison tool that is operated by a national authority or a verified comparison tool that is operated by a private company. (24) greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availability of effective mean s of dispute settlement for all consumers. member states should introduce speedy and effective complaint handling procedures. (25) all consumers should be able to benefit from directly participating in the market, in particular by adjusting their consumpti on according to market signals and in return benefit from lower electricity prices or other incentive payments. the benefits of this active participation are likely to increase over time when electric vehicles, heat pumps and other flexible loads become mo re competitive. consumers should be enabled to participate in all forms of demand response and therefore should have the possibility to opt for having a smart metering system and a dynamic electricity pricing contract. this should allow them to adjust thei r consumption according to real time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transportation in different time periods, while member states should ensure a reasonable exposure of consumers to the wholesale price risk. member states s hould also ensure that those consumers who choose not to actively engage in the market are not penalised but instead their informed decision making on the options available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suitable for domestic market conditions. 14572/17 gw/ns 15 annex dge 2b en (26) all customer groups (industrial, commercial and households) should have access to the energy markets to trade their flexibility and self -generated electricity. customers should be allowed to make full use of the advantages of aggr egation of production and supply over larger regions and benefit from cross -border competition . [] market participants engaged in aggregation are likely to play an important role as intermediaries between customer groups and the market. member states shoul d be free to choose the appropriate implementation model and approach to governance , for independent aggregation while respecting the general principles as laid out in this directive. this could include market -based or regulatory principles which provide s olutions which achieve the provisions set out in this directive, including models where imbalances are corrected. the chosen model should contain t ransparent and fair rules [] to [] allow independent aggregators to fulfil this role and to ensure, that the final customer adequately benefits from their activity . products should be defined on all [] energy markets, including ancillary services and capacity markets so as to encourage the participation of demand response. (27) the 'european strategy for low emi ssion mobility' 7 stresses the need for the decarbonisation of the transport sector and the reduction of its emissions especially in urban areas and highlights the important role that electro -mobility can play in contributing to these objectives. moreover, the deployment of electro -mobility constitutes an important element of the energy transition. market rules set out in this directive should therefore contribute to creating favourable conditions for electric vehicles of all kinds. in particular, they shoul d safeguard the effective deployment of publicly accessible and private recharging points for electric vehicles and ensure the efficient integration of vehicle charging into system operation. 7 swd(2016) 244 final 14572/17 gw/ns 16 annex dge 2b en (28) demand response will be pivotal to enable smart charging o f electric vehicles and thereby enable the efficient integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid which will be crucial for the process of decarbonisation of transport. (29) consumers should be able to consume, store and/or sell self -generat ed electricity to the market. new technology developments will facilitate these activities in the future. however, legal and commercial barriers exist including for example disproportionate fees for internally consumed electricity, obligations to feed self - generated electricity to the energy system, administrative burdens such as for self - generators who sell electricity to the system to comply with the requirements for suppliers, etc. all these obstacles that prevent consumers from self -generating and fro m consuming, storing or selling self -generated electricity to the market should be removed while it should be ensured that self -generating consumers contribute adequately to system costs. member states may have different governing provisions with respect to taxes and levies for individual and jointly acting final customers as well as for household and other final customers in their national legislation. 14572/17 gw/ns 17 annex dge 2b en (30) distributed energy technologies and consumer empowerment have made community energy [] an effective and cost -efficient way to meet citizens' needs and expectations regarding energy sources, services and local participation. community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers t o have a direct stake in producing, consuming or sharing energy between each other []. community energy initiatives focus primarily on providing affordable energy of a specific kind, such as renewable energy, for their members or shareholders rather than p rioritising profit -making like a traditional energy company. by directly engaging with consumers community energy initiatives are demonstrating their potential in facilitating the up -take of new technologies and consumption patterns, including smart distri bution grids and demand response, in an integrated manner. community energy can also advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consumption and lower supply tariffs. community energy also enables certain grou ps of household consumers to participate in the energy market who otherwise might not have been able to do so. where they have been successfully operated such initiatives have delivered economic, social and environmental value to the community that goes be yond the mere benefits derived from the provision of energy services. [] the directive aims at recognizing certain categories of citizen energy initiatives at the european level as \"energy communities\" to provide them with an enabling framework, fair treat ment, a level playing field and a well -defined catalogue of rights and obligations. household consumers should be allowed to voluntarily participate in a community energy initiative as well as to leave it, without losing access to the network operated by t he community energy initiative or their rights as consumers. access to a [] energy community's network should be granted on fair and cost -reflective terms. 14572/17 gw/ns 18 annex dge 2b en (30a) energy community membership is open to all categories of entities, however the decision -makin g powers within an energy community should be limited to those members or shareholders that are not engaged in large scale commercial activity and for which the energy sector does not constitute a primary area of economic activity. energy communities, as d efined in the directive, are deemed a category of citizens' initiatives that should be subject to recognition and protection under the union law. the definition of energy communities does not prevent the existence of other citizen initiatives such as those stemming from private law agreements. (30b) the provisions on energy communities contain a catalogue of applicable rights and obligations, which could be deduced from other, already existing rules, such as the freedom of contracting, supplier switching r ules, distribution system operator responsibilities, network charges, balancing obligation. 14572/17 gw/ns 19 annex dge 2b en (30c) energy communities constitute a new type of entity due to their membership structure, governance requirements and purpose. they should be allowed to operat e on the market on a level -playing field without distorting competition subject to the same rights and obligations as the other electricity undertakings. the rights and obligations should apply according to the roles undertaken such as the roles of final c ustomers, generators, suppliers, distribution system operators. energy communities should not face regulatory restrictions if they apply existing or future ict technologies to share electricity from generation assets within the community between its member s or shareholders based on market principles, for example by offsetting the energy component of members using the generation available within the community, even over the public network, provided that both metering points belong to the community. virtual s haring enables members to be supplied with electricity from the generation plants within the community without being in direct physical proximity or behind a single metering point. where electricity is shared over the public network it should not affect th e collection of network charges, tariffs, taxes and levies related to electricity flows. the sharing should be facilitated according the obligations and correct timeframes for balancing, metering and settlement. the provisions on energy communities do not interfere with the member states' competence to design and implement their policies for the energy sector related to taxation, network charges and tariffs or energy policy financing systems and cost sharing as long as those policies are non -discriminatory and lawful. 14572/17 gw/ns 20 annex dge 2b en (30d) the directive foresees a possibility for member states to allow an energy community to become a distribution system operator either under the general regime or in accordance with art. 38 as the so -called \"closed distribution system opera tor\". once an energy community is granted the status as a distribution system operator, it should be treated and be subject to the same obligations as distribution system operators. the provisions on energy communities only clarifies aspects of distributio n system operation that are likely to be relevant for energy communities, while other aspects on distribution system operation apply according to the provisions on distribution system operators. (31) energy bills [] are an important means through which cu stomers are informed. as well as data on consumption and costs, they can also convey other information that helps consumers to compare their current deal with other offers. however, [] bill -related disputes are a very common source of consumer complaints, a factor which contributes to persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement in the energy sector . it is therefore necessary to make bills [] clearer and easier to und erstand, as well as to ensure that bills and billing information [ ] prominently display a limited number of important information items that are necessary to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption, compare offers and switch suppliers. other information items should be available to final customers in, with or signposted to within their bills. these can be displayed in the bill, be in a separate document attached to the bill, or the bill can contain a reference to where the customer can easily find the information on a website, app or through other means. (31a) the regular provision of accurate billing information based on actual consumption, facilitated by smart meters, is important for helping consumers to control their electricity consumptio n and costs. nevertheless, consumers, in particular household consumers, should have access to flexible arrangements for actual payment. this enables, for example, consumers to be provided frequent billing information whilst only paying on a quarterly basi s, or products where the consumer pays the same amount every month independent of the actual consumption. 14572/17 gw/ns 21 annex dge 2b en (31b) the provisions on billing provided for in directive 2012/27/eu of the european parliament and of the council 8 should be updated, streamlined an d moved to directive 2009/72/ec, where they fit more coherently. (32) member states should encourage the modernisation of distribution networks, such as through the introduction of smart grids, which should be built in a way that encourages decentralised generation and energy efficiency. (33) engaging consumers requires appropriate incentives and technologies such as smart metering. smart metering systems empower consumers as they allow them to receive accurate and near -real time feedback on their energy c onsumption or generation allowing them to manage it better, participate in and reap benefits from demand side response programmes and other services, and lower their electricity bill. smart metering also enables distribution system operators to have better visibility of their networks, and consequently reduce their operation and maintenance costs and pass those savings to the distribution tariffs which are ultimately borne by consumers. (34) when it comes to deciding at national level on the smart metering deployment , it should be possible to base this on an economic assessment. should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such metering systems is economically reasonable and cost -effective only for consumers with a certain amount of electricity consumption, member states should be able to take that into account when proceeding with implementation. 8 directive 2012/27/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 25 october 2012 on energy efficiency, amending directives 2009/125/ec and 2010/30/eu and repealing directives 2004/8/ec and 2006/32/ec (oj l 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). 14572/17 gw/ns 22 annex dge 2b en (35) member states that are not systematically rolling out smart metering should give the possibility to consumers to benefit, upon request and under fair and reasonable conditions, and by providing them with all the relevant information, from the installation of an electricity smart meter. where consumers do not have smart meters, they should be entitled to meters that fulfil the minimum requirements n ecessary to provide them with the billing information specified in this directive. (36) in order to assist consumers' active participation in the electricity market, the smart metering systems to be deployed by member states in their territory should be in teroperable, not represent a barrier to switching of supplier, and should be equipped with fit -for -purpose functionalities that allow consumers to have near -real time access to their consumption data, modulate their energy consumption and, to the extent th at the supporting infrastructure permits, offer their flexibility to the network and to energy services companies, be rewarded for it, and achieve savings in their electricity bill. (37) a key aspect of supplying customers is access to objective and trans parent consumption data. thus, consumers should have access to their consumption data and associated prices and services costs so that they can invite competitors to make an offer based on those data. consumers should also have the right to be properly inf ormed about their energy consumption. prepayments should not place a disproportionate disadvantage at their users, while different payment systems should be non -discriminatory. information on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough will create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feedback on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour. in this respect, full implementation of directive 2012/27/eu of the european parliament and of the coun cil 9 will help consumers to reduce their energy costs. 9 directive 2012/27/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 25 october 2012 on energy efficiency, amending directives 2009/125/ec and 2010/30/eu and repealing directives 2004/8/ec and 2006/32/ec (oj l 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). 14572/17 gw/ns 23 annex dge 2b en (38) currently different models for the management of data have been developed or are under development in the member states following the deployment of smart metering systems. independently of the d ata management model it is important that member states put in place transparent rules under which data can be accessed under non -discriminatory conditions and ensure the highest level of cybersecurity and data protection as well as the impartiality of the entities which handle data. (39) member states should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable and energy poor customers in the context of the internal market in electricity. such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances in the member states in question and may include social or energy policy measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, investment in residential energy efficiency or consumer protection such as disconnection safeguards . where universal service is also provided to small enterprises, measures to ensure that such universal service is provided may differ according to whether they are aimed at household customers or small enterprises. (40) energy services are fundamental to safeguard the well -being of the union citizens. adequate warmth, cooling, lighting and the energy to power appliances are essential services to guarantee a decent standard of living and citizens' health. furthermore, access to these energy services empower s european citizens to fulfil their potential and it enhances social inclusion. energy poor households are unable to afford these energy services due to a combination of low income, high energy expenditure and poor energy efficiency of their homes. member states should collect the right information to monitor the number of households in energy poverty. accurate measurement should assist member states to identify those households affected by energy poverty in order to provide targeted support. the commission should actively support the implementation of the provisions on energy poverty by facilitating the sharing of good practices between member states. 14572/17 gw/ns 24 annex dge 2b en (41) member states which are affected by energy poverty and which have not yet done so should therefore de velop national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle this problem , aiming at decreasing the number of people suffering such situation. low income, high energy expenditure, and poor energy efficiency of homes are , among others, relevant fac tors in designing indicators for the measurement of energy poverty . in any event, member states should ensure the necessary energy supply for vulnerable and energy poor customers. in doing so, an integrated approach, such as in the framework of energy and social policy, could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for housing. at the very least, this directive should allow national policies in favour of vulnerable and energy poor customers. (42) distribution sys tem operators have to cost -efficiently integrate new electricity generation especially generating installations using renewable energy sources and new loads such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. for this purpose distribution system operators should be enabled and incentivised to use services from distributed energy resources such as demand response and energy storage, based on market procedures, in order to efficiently operate their networks and avoid costly network expansions. member states should put in place appropriate measures such as national network codes and market rules, and incentivise distribution system operators through network tariffs which do not create obstacles to flexibility or to the improvement of energy efficiency in the grid. member states should also introduce network development plans for distribution systems in order to support the integration of generating installations using renewable energy sources, facilitate the development of storage facilities and the electrification of the transport sector, and provide to system users adequate information regarding the foreseen expansions or upgrades of the network, as currently such procedure does not exist in the majority of member states. 14572/17 gw/ns 25 annex dge 2b en (42a) network operators should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities. in the new electricity market design storage services should be market -based and competitive. consequently, cross -subsidization between storage and the regulated function of distribution or transmission of elec tricity should be avoided. such restriction on storage facilities ownership is to prevent distortion of competition, eliminate the risk of discrimination, safeguard fair access to storage services to all market participants and to foster effective and effi cient use of storage facilities, beyond the operation of the distribution or transmission system. this should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the rights and principles established under the charter of fundamental rights of the european union, in particular the freedom to conduct a business and the right to property guaranteed by articles 16 and 17 of the charter. (43) non -discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level. to create a le vel playing field at retail level, the activities of distribution system operators should therefore be monitored so that they are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in particul ar in relation to household and small non -household customers. (44) where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated energy supply requiring specific operational standards, or a closed distribution system is main tained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribution system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship betw een the distribution system operator and the users of the system. industrial, commercial or shared services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrated facilities or chemical industry sites can include cl osed distribution systems because of the specialised nature of their operations. 14572/17 gw/ns 26 annex dge 2b en (45) in order to secure competition and the supply of electricity at the most competitive price, member states and national regulatory authorities should facilitate cross -bor der access for new suppliers of electricity from different energy sources as well as for new providers of power generation. (46) without effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically integrated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks. (47) only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discr iminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effective unbundling. ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production intere sts, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply. for that reason, the european parliament, in its resolution of 10 july 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market 10 referred to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most effective tool to promote investments in infrastructure in a non -discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. under ownership unbundling, member states should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a generation or supply undertaking and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or tr ansmission system. conversely, control over a transmission system or transmission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. within those limits, a generation or supply undert aking should be able to have a minority shareholding in a transmission system operator or transmission system. 10 oj c 175 e, 10.7.2008, p.206. 14572/17 gw/ns 27 annex dge 2b en (48) any system for unbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system op erators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory autho rities. (49) since ownership unbundling requires, in some instances, the restructuring of undertakings, member states that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions. in view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors, the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors. (50) under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and generation interests and to prevent exchanges of any confidential information, the same person should not be a member of the managing boards of both a transmission system operator or a transmission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply. for the same reason, th e same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operator or a transmission system and to exercise control or any right over a generation or supply undertaking. (51) the setting up of a system operator or a transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets whilst ensuring effective separation of interests, provided that such indepen dent system operator or such independent transmission operator performs all the functions of a system operator and detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place. (52) where, on 3 september 2009, an undertaking owning a tr ansmission system was part of a vertically integrated undertaking, member states should therefore be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and generation inter ests. 14572/17 gw/ns 28 annex dge 2b en (53) to preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of vertically integrated undertakings, member states should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestiture or by splitting the shares of the integrated under taking into shares of the network undertaking and shares of the remaining supply and generation undertaking, provided that the requirements resulting from ownership unbundling are complied with. (54) the full effectiveness of the independent system operato r or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. the rules on the independent transmission operator provide an appropriate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, acc ess for new market entrants and the integration of electricity markets. effective unbundling through the independent transmission operator provisions should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmis sion system operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, connecting new production capacities to the network and market integration through regional cooperation. the independence of the transmission operator should also, inter alia, be ens ured through certain \u201acooling -off\u2122 periods during which no management or other relevant activity giving access to the same information as could have been obtained in a managerial position is exercised in the vertically integrated undertaking. (55) a membe r state has the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in its territory. where a member state has exercised that right, an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an independent transmission operator. furthermore , an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from a member state that has opted for full ownership unbundling. 14572/17 gw/ns 29 annex dge 2b en (56) the implementat ion of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non -discrimination between the public and private sectors. to that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or th e independent system operator option, solely or jointly, over the composition, voting or decision of the bodies of both the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the generation or supply undertakings. with regard to ownership unbund ling and the independent system operator solution, provided that the member state in question is able to demonstrate that the requirement is complied with, two separate public bodies should be able to control generation and supply activities on the one han d and transmission activities on the other. (57) fully effective separation of network activities from supply and generation activities should apply throughout the union to both union and non - union undertakings. to ensure that network activities and supply and generation activities throughout the union remain independent from each other, regulatory authorities should be empowered to refuse certification to transmission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. to ensure the consis tent application of those rules across the union, the regulatory authorities should take utmost account of the commission\u2122s opinion when the former take decisions on certification. to ensure, in addition, respect for the international obligations of the un ion, and solidarity and energy security within the union, the commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries. (58) authorisation procedures should not lead to an administrative burden disproportionate to the size and potential impact of electricity producers. unduly lengthy authorisation procedures may constitute a barrier to ac cess for new market entrants. 14572/17 gw/ns 30 annex dge 2b en (59) energy regulators need to be able to take decisions in relation to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market in electricity is to function properly, and to be fully independent from any other public or private interests. this precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary supervision in accordance with the constitutional laws of the member states. in addition, approval of the budget of the regulator by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy. the provisions relating to the autonomy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory authority should be implemented in the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules. while contributing to the independence of the national regulatory authority from any political or economic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme, it should be possible for member states to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the boar d. (60) national regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the calculation of the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system operator(s), or on the b asis of a proposal agreed between those operator(s) and the users of the network. in carrying out those tasks, national regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission and distribution tariffs are non -discriminatory and cost -reflective, and should t ake account of the long -term, marginal, avoided network costs from distributed generation and demand -side management measures. (61) energy regulators should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose eff ective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them. to this end, regulatory authorities should be able to request relevan t information from electricity undertakings, make appropriate and sufficient investigations and settle disputes. energy regulators should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures ens uring customer benefits through the promotion of effective competition necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. 14572/17 gw/ns 31 annex dge 2b en (62) energy regulators should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of univers al and public service in compliance with market opening, to the protection of vulnerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of consumer protection measures. those provisions should be without prejudice to both the commission\u2122s powers concerning the application of competition rules including the examination of mergers with a union dimension, and the rules on the internal market such as the free movement of capital. the independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a national regulator h as a right to appeal could be a court or other tribunal empowered to conduct a judicial review. (62a) the electricity and gas directives do not deprive the government of the possibility of establishing and issuing its national energy policy. this means tha t, depending on the national constitution, it could be the government\u2122s competency to determine the policy framework within which the regulatory authorities must operate, for instance concerning security of supply. however, general energy policy guidelines issued by the government must not impinge on the regulatory authority independence and autonomy. (63) under [recast of regulation 714/2009 as proposed by com(2016)861/2], the commission may adopt guidelines or network codes to achieve the necessary degree of harmonisation. such guidelines or network codes , which constitute binding implementing measures, are, also with regard to certain provisions of this directive, a useful tool which can be adapted quickly where necessary. (64) member states and the ener gy community contracting parties should closely cooperate on all matters concerning the development of an integrated electricity trading region and should take no measures that endanger the further integration of electricity markets or security of supply o f member states and contracting parties. 14572/17 gw/ns 32 annex dge 2b en (65) this directive should be read together with [recast of regulation 714/2009 as proposed by com(2016)861/2] which lays down key principles of the new market design for electricity which will enable better rewar d for flexibility, provide adequate price signals and ensure the development of functioning integrated short -term markets. [recast of regulation 714/2009 as proposed by com(2016)861/2] also sets out new rules in various areas including capacity mechanisms and cooperation between transmission system operators. (66) since the objective of this directive, namely the creation of a fully operational internal electricity market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore be better achi eved at union level, the union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on the european union. in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that article, this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (67) this directive respects the fundamental rights, and observes the principles, recognised in particular by the charter of fundamental rights of the european union . (68) [] 14572/17 gw/ns 33 annex dge 2b en (69 ) in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this directive , implementing powers should be conferred on the commission in order to determine interoperability for a common european data format and non -discriminatory and transparent proc edures for accessing the data on metering, consumption data as well as data required for consumer switching. those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council 11. (70) the obligation to transpose this directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier directive. the obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under th e earlier directive. (71) in accordance with the joint political declaration of 28 september 2011 of member states and the commission on explanatory documents 12, member states have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their tra nsposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. with regard to this directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. (72) this directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the member states relating to the time -limit for the transposition into national law and the date of application of the directive set out in annex iv. have adopted this directive: 11 regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council of 16 february 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by member states of the c ommission\u2122s exercise of implementing powers (oj l 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13). 12 oj c 369, 17.12.2011, p. 14. 14572/17 gw/ns 34 annex dge 2b en chapter i subject matter and definitions article 1 subject matter this directive establishes common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution , storage and supply of electricity, together with consumer protection provisions, with a view to creating truly integrated competitive , consumer -centred and flexible , fair and transparent electricity markets in the union. using the advantages of an integrated mar ket, the directive aims at ensuring affordable energy prices for consumers, a high degree of security of supply and a smooth transition towards a [] low -carbon energy system . it lays down key rules relating to the organisation and functioning of the europe an electricity sector, in particular rules on consumer empowerment and protection, on open access to the integrated market, on third party access to transmission and distribution infrastructure, unbundling rules, and on independent national energy regulato rs. article 2 definitions for the purposes of this directive, the following definitions apply: 1.
