(2) well -functioning markets and systems are the best guarantee of security of supply. however , even where markets and systems function well, the risk of an electricity crisis (as a result of extreme weather conditions, malicious attacks or a fuel shortage) can never be excluded. the consequences of crisis situations often extend beyond national bo rders. even where incidents start locally their effects can rapidly spread across borders. some extreme circumstances, such as a cold spell, a heat wave or a cyber -attack, may affect entire regions at the same time. (3) in a context of interlinked electri city markets and systems, crisis prevention and management cannot be considered a purely national responsibility. a common framework of rules and coordinated procedures are needed, to ensure that member states and other actors cooperate effectively across borders in a spirit of transparency and solidarity. 10692/17 bl/ns 4 annex dge 2b en (4) directive 2005/89/ec of the european parliament and of the council 1 sets out the necessary measures that the member states should take in order to ensure security of electricity supply in general. t he provisions of that directive have largely been superseded by subsequent legislation, in particular as regards how markets should be organised so as to ensure that sufficient capacity is available, how transmission system operators should cooperate to guarantee system stability 2 and as regards the need to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is in place. 3 this regulation addresses the specific issue of crisis prevention and management in the electricity sector. (5) the system operation guidelines 4 and the network code on emergency and restoration 5 constitute a detailed rulebook governing how transmission system operators and other relevant actors should act and cooperate to ensure system security. these technical rules should ensure that most electricit y incidents are dealt with effectively at operational level. this regulation focuses on electricity crisis situations that may have a larger scale and impact. it sets out what member states should do to prevent such situations and what measures they can ta ke should system operational rules alone no longer suffice. even in crisis situations, however, system operation rules should continue to be fully respected. 1 directive 2005/89/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 18 january 2006 concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment (oj l 33, 4.2.2006, p. 22). 2 reference to the revised third package 3 regulation (eu) no 347/2013 of the european parliament and of the council of 1 7 april 2013 on guidelines for trans -european energy infrastructure, oj l 115, 24.4.2013, p. 39. 4 commission regulation (eu) \u2013/\u2013of xxx establishing a guideline on electricity transmission system operation, oj [...] 5 commission regulation (eu) \u2013/\u2013of xxx e stablishing a network code on electricity emergency and restoration, oj [...]. 10692/17 bl/ns 5 annex dge 2b en (6) this regulation sets out a common framework of rules on how to prevent, prepare for and mana ge electricity crisis situations, bringing more transparency in the preparation phase and during an electricity crisis and ensuring that, even in a crisis, electricity is delivered where it is needed most . it requires member states to cooperate at regional level, in a spirit of solidarity. it also sets out a framework for an effective monitoring of security of supply in europe via the electricity coordination group. this should result in better risk preparedness at a lower cost. it should also strengthen th e internal energy market by enhancing trust and confidence across member states and ruling out inappropriate state interventions in crisis situations, in particular avoiding undue curtailment of cross -border flows. (7) the directive on security of network and information systems (the nis directive) 1 provides general rules, while specific rules on cybersecurity will be developed through a network code as foreseen in the [ proposed electricity regulation ]. this regulation complements the nis directive ensuring that cyber -incidents are properly identified as a risk, and the measures taken to deal with them are properly reflected in the risk -preparedness plans. (8) council directive 2008/114/ec 2 lays down a process with a view to enhancing the security of design ated european critical infrastructure, including certain electricity infrastructure, in the union. directive 2008/114/ec together with this regulation contributes to creating a comprehensive approach to the energy security of the union. 1 directive (eu) 2016/1148 of the european parliament and of the council of 6 july 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information system s across the union, oj l 194, 19.07.2016, p. 1 -30. 2 directive 2008/114/ec of 8 december 2008 on the identification and designation of european critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection (oj l 345, 23.12.2008, p. 75 ). 10692/17 bl/ns 6 annex dge 2b en (9) decision no 1 313/2013/eu 1 of the european parliament and of the council on a union civil protection mechanism sets out requirements for member states to develop risk assessments at national or appropriate sub -national level every three years, and to develop and refine disaster risk management planning. the specific risk prevention, preparedness and planning actions in this regulation should be coherent with the wider, multi -hazard national risk assessments required under decision no 1313/2013/eu. (10) to facilitate prev ention, information exchange and ex -post evaluation of electricity crises, member states should designate one competent authority as a contact point. this may be an existing or new entity. (11) a common approach to crisis prevention and management requires, above all, that member states use the same methods and definitions to identify risks relating to the security of electricity supply and are in a position effectively to compare how well they and their neighbours perform in that area. the regulati on identifies two indicators to monitor the security of electricity supply in the union: 'expected energy non served' (eens), expressed in gwh/year, and 'loss of load expectation' (lole), expressed in hours/year. these indicators are part of the european r esource adequacy assessment carried out by the european network of transmission system operators for electricity (entso -e), pursuant to [ article 19 of the proposed electricity regulation ]. the electricity coordination group shall carry out regular monitori ng of the security of supply based on the results of these indicators. the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators (agency) should also use these indicators, when reporting on member states' performance in the area of security of supply in its annu al electricity market monitoring reports, pursuant to [ article 16 of the proposed acer regulation ]. 1 decision no 1313/2013/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 17 december 2013 on a union civil protection mechanism (oj l 347, 20.12.2013, p 24). 10692/17 bl/ns 7 annex dge 2b en (12) to ensure the coherence of risk assessments that builds trust between member states in a crisis situation a common approach to identifying risk scen arios is needed. therefore, entso -e should develop a common methodology for risk identification in cooperation with the agency, with entso -e proposing the methodology and the agency approving it. (13) on the basis of this common methodology, entso -e should regularly draw up and update regional crisis scenarios and identify the most relevant risks for each region such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, fuel shortages or malicious attacks. when considering the crisis scenario of gas fuel shorta ge, the risk of gas supply disruption should be assessed based on the gas supply and infrastructure disruption scenarios developed by the european network of transmission system operators for gas pursuant to article 6.6 of the gas security of supply regula tion [proposed gas security of supply regulation ]. member states should establish and update their national crisis scenarios on this basis, in principle every three years. the scenarios should provide the basis for the risk -preparedness plans. when identi fying risks on national level the member states should also describe possible risks they see in relation to the ownership of infrastructure relevant for security of supply, and possible measures taken, if any, to address such risks (such as general or sect or-specific investment screening laws, special rights for certain shareholders, etc.), with an indication why in their view such measures are justified. (14) a regional approach to identifying risk scenarios and developing preventive and mitigating measure s should bring significant benefits in terms of the effectiveness of measures and optimal use of resources. moreover, in a simultaneous electricity crisis, a coordinated and pre -agreed approach will ensure a consistent response and reduce the risk of negat ive spill -over effects that purely national measures could have in neighbouring member states. this regulation therefore requires member states to cooperate in a regional context. 10692/17 bl/ns 8 annex dge 2b en [(15) as stated in the [ proposed electricity regulation ], the regional oper ational centres should regularly assess relevant risks as they are entrusted with the operational management of such situations. to ensure that they can carry out their tasks effectively and act in close cooperation with relevant national authorities with a view to preventing and mitigating larger -scale incidents, the regional cooperation required under this regulation should build on the regional cooperation structures used at technical level, namely the groups of member states sharing the same regional op erational centre. ] (16) the [ proposed electricity regulation ] prescribes the use of a common methodology for the medium to long -term european resource adequacy assessment (from 10 year -ahead to year ahead), with a view to ensuring that member states' decis ions as to possible investment needs are made on a transparent and commonly agreed basis. this assessment has a different purpose than the short -term adequacy assessments which are used to detect possible adequacy related problems in short time -frames, nam ely seasonal outlooks (six months ahead) and week -ahead to intraday adequacy assessments . regarding short -term assessments, there is a need for a common approach to the way possible adequacy -related problems are detected. the entso -e is to issue winter and summer outlooks to alert member states and transmission system operators to security of supply related risks that might occur in the following six months. to improve these outlooks, they should be based on a common probabilistic methodology proposed by en tso -e and approved by the agency. [in order to reinforce the regional approach to assessing risks, entso -e should be able to delegate tasks related to seasonal outlooks to regional operational centres. ] (17) transmission system operators [ and regional ope rational centres ] should apply the methodology used to prepare seasonal outlooks when carrying out any other type of short -term risk assessment, namely the week -ahead to intraday generation adequacy forecasts provided for in commission regulation on establ ishing a guideline on electricity transmission system operation. 10692/17 bl/ns 9 annex dge 2b en (18) to ensure a common approach to crisis prevention and management, the competent authority of each member state should draw up a risk -preparedness plan, after consulting stakeholders. th e plans should describe effective, proportionate and non -discriminatory measures addressing all identified crisis scenarios. plans should provide transparency especially as regards the conditions in which non -market measures can be taken to mitigate crisis situations. all envisaged non -market measures should comply with the rules set out in this regulation. (19) plans should consist of two parts, setting out national measures and regional measures agreed between the member states in the region. regional mea sures are necessary especially in the event of a simultaneous crisis, when a coordinated and pre -agreed approach will ensure a consistent response and reduce the risk of negative spill -over effects. plans should take account of the specific characteristics of the member state and set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of the competent authorities. national measures should take full account of the regional measures agreed and take full advantage of the opportunities provided by regional cooperation. the plans should be technical and operational in nature, their function being to help prevent the occurrence or escalation of an electricity crisis and to mitigate its effects. (20) plans should be updated regularly. to ensure that the plans are always up -to-date and effective, the competent authorities of each region should organise annual simulations in cooperation with [regional operational centres ] to test their suitability. (21) templates should facilitate the preparation of the plans and consultation with other member states in the relevant region and the electricity coordination group. consultation within the region and via the electricity coordination group should ensure that measures taken in one member state or region do not put at risk the securi ty of supply of other member states or regions. 10692/17 bl/ns 10 annex dge 2b en (22) information exchange in the event of a crisis situation is essential in order to ensure coordinated action and targeted assistance. therefore, this regulation obliges member states to inform neighbouring member states and the commission without delay when confronted with an electricity crisis. they should also provide information on the causes of the crisis, measures taken and planned to mitigate the crisis and the possible need for assistance from other member states. where this assistance goes beyond electricity security of supply, the union civil protection mechanism shall remain the applicable legislative framework. (23) it is important to facilitate communication and awareness between memb er states, whenever they have specific, serious and reliable information that an event may occur that is likely to result in a significant deterioration of the electricity supply. in such circumstances the member states should inform the commission and the electricity coordination group without delay, providing, in particular, information on the causes of the deterioration, the planned measures to prevent an electricity crisis and the possible need for assistance from other member states. (24) in the event of an electricity crisis member states should assist each other in a spirit of solidarity and ensure that electricity is delivered where it is most needed. this cooperation should be based on pre -agreed measures set out in the risk -preparedness plans. whe n agreeing on cooperation, member states should take account of social and economic factors, including citizens' security, and proportionality. they are encouraged to share best practice and use the electricity coordination group as a discussion platform t o identify available options for cooperation and solidarity arrangements, including compensation mechanisms. the commission may facilitate the preparation of the regionally coordinated measures in the concerned region. 10692/17 bl/ns 11 annex dge 2b en (25) this regulation should enable electricity undertakings and customers to rely on market mechanisms as laid down in [ proposed electricity directive and electricity regulation ] for as long as possible when coping with electricity crisis situations. rules governing the internal market and system operation rules should be respected even in crisis situations. this means that non -market measures, such as forced demand disconnection, or the provision of extra supplies outside normal market functioning should be taken only as a last resort, when all possibilities offered by the market have been exhausted. therefore forced demand disconnection can be introduced only after all possibilities for voluntary demand disconnection have been exhausted. in addition, any non -market measures should be necess ary, proportionate, non -discriminatory and temporary. (26) in order to ensure transparency after an electricity crisis, the member states affected should carry out an ex -post evaluation of the crisis and its impacts, thereby duly associating its national r egulatory authority. such evaluation should take into account, inter alia , the effectiveness and proportionality of the measures taken as well as their economic cost. it should also cover cross -border considerations such as the impact of the measures on ot her member states and the level of assistance received from them. (27) the transparency obligations should ensure that all measures taken to prevent or manage crisis situations respect internal market rules and are in line with the principles of co -operati on and solidarity which underpin the energy union. (28) in 2012, the electricity coordination group was created as a forum to exchange information and foster co -operation across member states, in particular in the area of security of supply. 1 through this regulation, its role is reinforced. it should carry out specific tasks, notably in connection with the preparation of the risk -preparedness plans, and will have a prominent role in monitoring member states' performance in the area of the security of elect ricity supply, and developing best practice on this basis. 1 commission decision of 15 november 2012 setting up the electricity coordination group (201 2/c 353/02), oj c 353, 17.11.2012, p. 2. 10692/17 bl/ns 12 annex dge 2b en (29) an electricity crisis might extend beyond union borders comprising also energy community countries. in order to ensure an efficient crisis management on borders between the member states and the contracting parties, the union should closely cooperate with the energy community contracting parties when preventing, preparing for and handling an electricity crisis. [ (30) to allow for a swift union response to changing circumstances as regards ri sk preparedness in the electricity sector, in order to reflect the experience gained in the application of this regulation and in order to reduce the administrative burden on member states , the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the trea ty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in respect of amendments of the templates for risk preparedness plans. it is particularly important that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its prepara tory work, including at expert level. when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, it should ensure that relevant documents are sent simultaneously to the european parliament and the council, in good time and in the appropriate manner. ] (31) the member s tates acting on their own cannot satisfactorily achieve the objective of this regulation, namely to ensure the most effective and efficient risk preparedness within the union. given the scale or effects of the action, it is better achieved at union level. the union may therefore adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union. in accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that article, this regulation does not go beyond w hat is necessary to achieve that objective.
