(2) in order to foster the competitiveness, efficiency and innovation capacity of the union's defence industry, which contributes to the union's strategic autonomy, a european defence industrial development programme (the \u2018programme\u2019) should be established. the programme should aim to enhance the competitiveness of the union's defence industry, contributing to the improvement of defence capabilities, inter alia, in relation to cyber defence, by supporting cooperation between undertakings throughout the union, including smes and middle capitalisation companies (mid-caps), research centres and universities, and collaboration between member states, in the development phase of defence products and technologies, thus facilitating better exploitation of economies of scale in the defence industry and promoting the standardisation of defence systems while improving their interoperability. the development phase, which follows the research and technology phase, entails significant risks and costs that hamper the further exploitation of the results of research and adversely impact the competitiveness of the union's defence industry. by supporting the development phase, the programme would contribute to a better exploitation of the results of defence research and would help to cover the gap between research and production. it would also promote all forms of innovation, since the positive effects of such support can be expected to spill over into the civilian sector. the programme complements activities carried out in accordance with article 182 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union and it does not cover the production or procurement of defence products or technologies. (3) in order to achieve more innovative solutions and to foster an open internal market, the programme should provide strong support to the cross-border participation of smes and help create new market opportunities. (4) the programme should cover a two-year period from 1 january 2019 to 31 december 2020. the financial amount for the implementation of the programme should be determined for that period. (5) this regulation lays down a financial envelope for the entire duration of the programme, which is to constitute the prime reference amount, within the meaning of point 17 of the interinstitutional agreement of 2 december 2013 between the european parliament, the council and the commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management ( 3 ) , for the european parliament and the council during the annual budgetary procedure. (6) when implementing the programme, all funding instruments should be used in accordance with regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012 of the european parliament and of the council ( 4 ) , with a view to maximising the development of defence products and technologies. however, in view of the two-year duration of the programme, the use of financial instruments could raise practical difficulties. consequently, during that initial period, priority should be given to the use of grants and, in exceptional circumstances, to public procurement. financial instruments could be an appropriate tool for use in the fund after 2020. (7) the commission may entrust part of the implementation of the programme to entities referred to in point (c) of article 58(1) of regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012. (8) after agreeing on common defence capability priorities at union-level, particularly through the capability development plan, also taking into account the coordinated annual review on defence, and with a view to fulfilling the eu's level of ambition as agreed by the council in its conclusions of 14 november 2016 and endorsed by the european council on 15 december 2016, member states identify and consolidate military requirements and set the technical specifications of the project. (9) member states should, where appropriate, also appoint a project manager, such as an international project management organisation, for example the organisation for joint armament cooperation, or an entity, such as the european defence agency, to lead the work related to the development of a collaborative action supported by the programme. where such an appointment is made, the commission should consult the project manager on progress made with regard to the action prior to executing the payment to the beneficiary of the eligible action so that the project manager can ensure that the time-frames are respected by the beneficiaries. (10) the union financial support should not affect the transfer of defence-related products within the union in accordance with directive 2009/43/ec of the european parliament and of the council ( 5 ) , or the export of defence products, equipment or technologies. nor should it affect the discretion of member states regarding policy on the transfer within the union and the export of such products, including in line with the common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment laid down in council common position 2008/944/cfsp ( 6 ) . (11) as the objective of the programme is to support the competitiveness and efficiency of the union defence industry by de-risking the development phase of cooperative projects, actions related to the development of a defence product or technology, namely feasibility studies and other accompanying measures, design (including the technical specifications on which the design is based), system prototyping, testing, qualification, certification and increasing efficiency over the life cycle of a defence product or technology, should be eligible for funding under the programme. the upgrade of existing defence products and technologies, including the interoperability thereof, should also be eligible for funding under the programme. actions for the upgrade of existing defence products and technologies should be eligible only where pre-existing information needed to carry out the action is not subject to any restriction in a way that limits the ability to carry out the action. (12) given that the aim of the programme is, in particular, to enhance cooperation between undertakings across member states, an action should be eligible for funding under the programme only if it is to be carried out by a consortium of at least three undertakings based in at least three different member states. (13) cross-border collaboration between undertakings in the development of defence products and technologies has often been hampered by the difficulty to agree on common technical specifications or standards. the absence or paucity of common technical specifications or standards has led to increased complexity, delays and inflated costs in the development phase. for actions involving a higher level of technological readiness, an agreement on common technical specifications should be a primary condition to be eligible for funding under the programme. feasibility studies and actions which aim to support the establishment of common technical specifications or standards should also be eligible for funding under the programme. (14) in order to ensure that, in the implementation of this regulation, the international obligations of the union and its member states are respected, actions relating to products or technologies of which the use, development or production are prohibited by international law should not be eligible for funding under the programme. in that respect, the eligibility of actions for the development of new defence products or technologies, such as those that are specifically designed to carry out lethal strikes without any human control over the engagement decisions, should also be subject to developments in international law. (15) as the programme aims to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the union's defence industry, only entities which are established in the union and are not subject to control by a third country or by a third-country entity should, in principle, be eligible for funding. additionally, in order to ensure the protection of essential security and defence interests of the union and its member states, the infrastructure, facilities, assets and resources used by the beneficiaries and subcontractors in an action funded under the programme, should not be located on the territory of a third country. (16) in certain circumstances, it should be possible to derogate from the principle that beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in an action are not subject to control by a third country or by a third-country entity. in that context, undertakings established in the union that are controlled by a third country or by a third-country entity should be able to be eligible for funding provided that relevant, strict conditions relating to the security and defence interests of the union and its member states, as established in the framework of the common foreign and security policy pursuant to title v of the treaty on european union (teu), including in terms of strengthening the european defence technological and industrial base, are fulfilled. the participation of such undertakings should not contravene the objectives of the programme. beneficiaries should provide all relevant information about the infrastructure, facilities, assets and resources to be used in the action. member states' concerns regarding security of supply should also be taken into account. (17) cooperation between beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in the action and undertakings which are established in a third country or which are controlled by a third country or by a third-country entity should also be subject to relevant conditions relating to the security and defence interests of the union and its member states. in that context, there should be no unauthorised access by a third country or a third-country entity to classified information relating to the execution of the action. access to classified information is authorised in accordance with the relevant security rules applicable to european union classified information and to information classified according to national security classifications. (18) eligible actions developed in the context of permanent structured cooperation in the institutional framework of the union would ensure enhanced cooperation between undertakings in the different member states on a continuous basis and would thus directly contribute to the objectives of the programme. such actions should therefore be eligible for an increased funding rate. eligible actions developed with an appropriate level of participation of mid-caps and smes, and in particular cross-border smes, support the opening up of the supply chains and contribute to the objectives of the programme. such actions should therefore be eligible for an increased funding rate, including to compensate for the increased risk and the increased administrative burden. (19) if a consortium wishes to participate in an eligible action under the programme and financial assistance of the union is to take the form of a grant, the consortium should appoint one of its members as a coordinator. the coordinator should be the principal point of contact with the commission. (20) the promotion of innovation and technological development in the union defence industry should enable the skills and know-how in the union's defence industry to be maintained and developed and should contribute to strengthening its technological and industrial autonomy. in that context, the programme could also help identify where the union is dependent on third countries for the development of defence products and technologies. such promotion of innovation and technological development should also take place in a manner consistent with the security and defence interests of the union. accordingly, an action's contribution to those interests and to the defence capability priorities agreed by member states within the framework of the common foreign and security policy should serve as an award criterion. within the union, common defence capability priorities are identified in particular through the capability development plan. other union processes such as the coordinated annual review on defence and the permanent structured cooperation support the implementation of relevant priorities through enhanced cooperation. where appropriate, regional and international priorities, including those in the nato context, may also be taken into account, on condition that they serve the union's security and defence interests and do not prevent any member state from participating, while also taking account of the need to avoid unnecessary duplication. (21) the member states work individually and jointly on the development, production and operational use of unmanned aircraft, vehicles and vessels. operational use in this context comprises carrying out strikes on military targets. the research and development associated with the development of such systems, including both military and civilian systems, have been supported by union funds. it is planned that this will continue, possibly also under the programme. nothing in this regulation should hinder the legitimate use of such defence products or technologies developed under the programme. (22) in order to ensure that the funded actions are viable, member states' commitment to effectively contribute to the financing of the action should be established in writing for example by a letter of intent by the member states concerned. (23) in order to ensure that the funded actions contribute to the competitiveness and efficiency of the european defence industry, they should be market-oriented, demand driven and commercially viable in the medium to long term, including for dual-use technologies. the eligibility criteria should therefore take into account the fact that member states intend to procure the final defence product, or use the technology, in a coordinated way, while the award criteria should take into account the fact that member states commit politically or legally, to jointly use, own or maintain the final defence product or technology. (24) all award criteria should be taken into account when evaluating actions proposed for funding under the programme. since those criteria are not eliminatory, proposed actions that fail to satisfy one or several of those criteria should not be automatically excluded. (25) the financial assistance of the union under the programme should not exceed 20 % of the eligible cost of the action where it relates to system prototyping, which is often the most costly action in the development phase. however, it should be possible to cover the totality of the eligible costs for other actions in the development phase. in both instances, eligible costs should be understood within the meaning of article 126 of regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012. (26) as the programme should complement research activities, in particular in the defence area, and for the sake of consistency and administrative simplification, the same rules as those in the preparatory action on defence research (padr) and the horizon 2020 framework programme for research and innovation (2014-2020) (\u2018horizon 2020\u2019) should, to the extent possible, apply to the programme. it is therefore appropriate to allow for the reimbursement of indirect costs at a flat rate of 25 % as under padr and horizon 2020. (27) as union support aims to enhance the competitiveness of the defence sector and concerns only the specific development phase, the union should not have ownership of or intellectual property rights in the defence products or technologies resulting from the funded actions. the applicable intellectual property rights regime is to be agreed contractually by the beneficiaries. interested member states should also have the possibility to participate in follow-up cooperative procurement. furthermore, the results of actions funded under the programme should not be subject to control or restriction by a third country or a third-country entity. (28) the commission should establish a two-year work programme in line with the objectives of the programme. the work programme should set out in detail the categories of projects to be funded under the programme, including defence products and technologies such as remotely piloted systems, satellite communications, positioning, navigation and timing, autonomous access to space and permanent earth observation, energy sustainability, and cyber and maritime security , as well as high-end military capabilities in the air, land, maritime and joint domains, including enhanced situational awareness, protection, mobility, logistics and medical support and strategic enablers. (29) the commission should be assisted in the establishment of the work programme by a committee of member states (\u2018committee\u2019). the commission should endeavour to find solutions which command the widest possible support within the committee. in that context, the committee may meet in the format of national defence experts to provide specific assistance to the commission. it is for the member states to designate their respective representatives on that committee. committee members should be given early and effective opportunities to examine the draft implementing acts and express their views. (30) in light of the union policy on smes as being key to ensuring economic growth, innovation, job creation, and social integration in the union and the fact that the actions supported typically require trans-national collaboration, it is of importance that the work programme reflect and enable open and transparent cross-border access and participation of smes, and that therefore at least 10 % of the overall budget benefit such actions, allowing smes to be included in the value chains of the actions. a category of projects should be specifically dedicated to smes. (31) to ensure the success of the programme, the commission should endeavour to maintain a dialogue with a broad spectrum of europe's industry, including smes and non-traditional suppliers to the defence sector. (32) in order to benefit from its expertise in the defence sector, and in accordance with the competences attributed to it by the teu, the european defence agency should be invited as observer in the committee. the european external action service should also be invited to assist. (33) as a general rule, for the selection of actions to be funded by the programme, the commission or the entities referred to in point (c) of article 58(1) of regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012 should organise competitive calls as provided for in that regulation, and should ensure that the administrative procedures are kept as simple as possible and incur a minimum amount of additional expenses. however, in certain duly justified and exceptional circumstances, union funding may also be granted in accordance with article 190 of commission delegated regulation (eu) no 1268/2012 ( 7 ) . (34) after evaluation of the proposals with the help of independent experts, whose security credentials should be validated by member states, the commission should select the actions to be funded under the programme. the commission should establish a database of independent experts. the database should not be made public. the independent experts should be appointed on the basis of their skills, experience and knowledge, taking account of the tasks to be assigned to them. as far as possible, when appointing the independent experts, the commission should take appropriate measures to seek a balanced composition within the expert groups and evaluation panels in terms of variety of skills, experience, knowledge, geographical diversity and gender, taking into account the situation in the field of the action. an appropriate rotation of experts and appropriate private-public sector balance should also be sought. in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the commission as regards the adoption and the implementation of the work programme, as well as for awarding the funding to selected actions. those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council ( 8 ) . member states should be informed of the evaluation results and progress in the funded actions. (35) the examination procedure should be used for the adoption of those implementing acts taking into account their substantial implications for the implementation of this regulation. (36) the commission should draw up an implementation report at the end of the programme, examining the financial activities in terms of their financial implementation results and where possible, their impact. the implementation report should also analyse the cross-border participation of smes and mid-caps in actions under the programme as well as the participation of smes and mid-caps in the global value chain. the report should also include information on the origin of beneficiaries and the distribution of the generated intellectual property rights. (37) the financial interests of the union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties. (38) the commission and the member states should ensure the widest possible promotion of the programme in order to increase its effectiveness and thus to improve the competitiveness of the defence industry and defence capabilities of the member states. (39) since the objectives of this regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states in view of the costs and associated risks but can rather be better achieved at union level, the union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the teu. in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article, this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, have adopted this regulation: article 1 subject matter this regulation establishes a european defence industrial development

across borders, between undertakings, including smes and mid-caps, throughout the union, and collaboration between member states, in the development of defence products or technologies, while strengthening and improving the agility of defence supply and value chains, and fostering the standardisation of defence systems and their interoperability. such cooperation shall take place in line with defence capability priorities agreed by member states within the framework of the common foreign and security policy and particularly in the context of the capability development plan. in that context, regional and international priorities, when they serve the union's security and defence interests as determined under the common foreign and security policy, and taking into account the need to avoid unnecessary duplication, may also be taken into account, where appropriate, wherever they do not exclude the possibility of participation of any member state; (c) to foster better exploitation of the results of defence research and contribute to development after the research phase, thereby supporting the competitiveness of the european defence industry on the internal market

achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden and the risk of conflict of interests. 3. the union's financial assistance shall be implemented by the commission as provided for by regulation (eu, euratom) no 966/2012 directly or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to the entities listed in point (c) of article 58(1) of that regulation. 4. member states shall, where appropriate, appoint a project manager. the commission shall consult the project manager on the progress achieved in connection with the action before executing the payment to the eligible beneficiaries. article 6 eligible actions 1. the programme shall provide support for actions by beneficiaries in the development phase covering both new defence products and technologies and the upgrade of existing products and technologies provided that the use of pre-existing information needed to carry out the action for the upgrade is not subject to a restriction by a third country or by a third-country entity, directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediary undertakings. an eligible action shall relate to one or more of the following: (a) studies, such as feasibility studies, and other accompanying measures; (b) the design of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the technical specifications on which such design has been developed, including partial tests for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment; (c) the system prototyping of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology; (d) the testing of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology; (e) the qualification of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology; (f) the certification of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology; (g) the development of technologies or assets increasing

interoperability of systems. 6. actions for the development of products and technologies the use, development or production of which is prohibited by international law shall not be eligible for funding under the programme. article 7 eligible entities 1. beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in the action shall be public or private undertakings established in the union. 2. the infrastructure, facilities, assets and resources of the beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in the action which are used for the purposes of the actions funded under the programme shall be located on the territory of the union for the entire duration of the action, and their executive management structures shall be established in the union. 3. for the purposes of the actions funded under the programme, the beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in the action shall not be subject to control by a third country or by a third-country entity. 4. by derogation from paragraph 3 of this article, and subject to article 15(2), an undertaking established in the union and controlled by a third country or by a third-country entity shall be eligible as a beneficiary or subcontractor involved in the action only if guarantees approved by the member state in which it is established in accordance with its national procedures are made available to the commission. those guarantees may refer to the undertaking's executive management structure established in the union. if deemed to be appropriate by the member state in which the undertaking is established, those guarantees may also refer to specific governmental rights in the control over the undertaking. the guarantees shall provide the assurances that the involvement in an action of such an undertaking would not contravene the security and defence interests of the union and its member states as established in the framework of the common foreign and security policy pursuant to title v of the teu, or the objectives set out in article 3. the guarantees shall also comply with the provisions of article 12. the guarantees shall in particular substantiate that, for the purpose of the action, measures are in place to ensure that: (a) control over the undertaking is not exercised in a manner that restrains or restricts its ability to carry out the action and to deliver results, that imposes restrictions concerning its infrastructure, facilities, assets, resources, intellectual property or know-how needed for the purpose of the action, or that undermines its capabilities and standards necessary to carry out the action; (b) access by a third country or by a third-country entity to sensitive information relating to the action is prevented and the employees or other persons involved in the action have national security clearances, where appropriate; (c) ownership of the intellectual property arising from, and the results of, the action remain within the beneficiary during and after completion of the action, are not subject to control or restriction by a third country or by a third-country entity, and are not exported outside the union nor is access to them from outside the union granted without the approval of the member state in which the undertaking is established and in accordance with the objectives set out in article 3. if deemed to be appropriate by the member state in which the undertaking is established, additional guarantees may be provided. the commission shall inform the committee referred to in article 13 of any undertaking deemed to be eligible in accordance with this paragraph. 5. where no competitive substitutes are readily available in the union, beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in the action may use their assets, infrastructure, facilities and resources located or held outside the territory of member states provided that that usage does not contravene the security and defence interests of the union and its member states, is consistent with the objectives of the programme and is fully in line with article 12. the costs related to those activities shall not be eligible for funding under the programme. 6. when carrying out an eligible action, beneficiaries and subcontractors involved in the action may also cooperate with undertakings established outside the territory of member states or controlled by a third country or by a third-country entity, including by using the assets, infrastructure, facilities and resources of such undertakings, provided that this does not contravene the security and defence interests of the union and its member states. such cooperation shall be consistent with the objectives set out in article 3 and shall be fully in line with article 12. there shall be no unauthorised access by a third country or other third-country entity to classified information relating to the carrying out of the action and potential negative effects over security of supply of inputs critical to the action shall be avoided. the costs related to those activities shall not be eligible for funding under the programme. 7. beneficiaries shall provide all relevant information necessary for the assessment of the eligibility criteria. in the event of a change during the carrying out of the action which might put into question the fulfilment of the eligibility criteria, the undertaking shall inform the commission, which shall assess whether the eligibility criteria continue to be met and shall address the potential impact on the funding of the action. 8. for the purposes of this article, subcontractors involved in the action refers to subcontractors with a direct contractual relationship to a beneficiary, other subcontractors to which at least 10 % of the total eligible cost of the action is allocated, as well as subcontractors which may require access to classified information in order to carry out the contract. article 8 declaration by undertakings each undertaking within a consortium wishing to participate in an action shall declare, by written statement, that it is fully aware of and complies with applicable national and union law relating to activities in the domain of defence. article 9 consortium 1. where the union's financial assistance is provided by means of a grant, the members of any consortium wishing to participate in an action shall appoint one of its members to act as coordinator. the coordinator shall be identified in the grant agreement. the coordinator shall be the principal point of contact between the members of the consortium in relations with the commission or the relevant funding body, unless specified otherwise in the grant agreement or in the event of non-compliance with its obligations under the grant agreement. 2. the members of a consortium participating in an action shall conclude an internal agreement establishing their rights and obligations with respect to the carrying out of the action in accordance with the grant agreement, except in duly justified cases provided for in the work programme or in the call for proposals. the internal agreement shall also include arrangements regarding the intellectual property rights relating to the products and technologies developed. article 10 award criteria actions proposed for funding under the programme shall be evaluated on the basis of each of the following criteria: (a) contribution to excellence in particular by showing that the proposed action presents significant advantages over existing defence products or technologies; (b) contribution to innovation, in particular by showing that the proposed action includes ground-breaking or novel concepts and approaches, new promising future technological improvements or the application of technologies or concepts previously not applied in the defence sector; (c) contribution to the competitiveness and growth of defence undertakings throughout the union, in particular by creating new market opportunities; (d) contribution to the industrial autonomy of the european defence industry and to the security and defence interests of the union by enhancing defence products or technologies in line with defence capability priorities agreed by member states within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, particularly in the context of the capability development plan, and, where appropriate, regional and international priorities provided that they serve the union's security and defence interests and do not exclude the possibility of participation of any member state;
