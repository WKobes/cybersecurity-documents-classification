of the council concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications and repealing directive 2002/58/ec (regulation on privac y and electronic communications) - examination of the presidency text i. introduction for the purpose of discussion in the wp tele meeting of 16 may and joint meeting of wp tele/dapix (fop on data retention) of 17 may , delegations will find in annex a revised text of the eprivacy proposal (epr ). 8537/18 km/ek 2 dge2b en delegations will find the overview of the modifications in section ii below. for ease of reference, the latest changes to the text in annex are underlined . the wp tele meeting of 16 may will focus on the who le proposal except for art. 2(2) and art. 11. the joint meeting of wp tele/dapix (fop on data retention) will focus on changes in art. 2(2) and art. 11 as outlined under section ii, point i. below. ii. amendments to the text a. in transmission taking into account the previous discussions and in particular the discussion in the wp tele of 19 april , the presidency is of the view that the term 'in transmission' leads to confusion between the purely technical and the legal understanding of the term . the presidency therefore proposes to remove the phrase from articles 2 and 3 . in the presidency's view the protection of content should be ensured during the end -to-end exchange between end -users, irrespective of whether the data is technically 'in trans mission' or 'at rest'. the protection should last until the 'receipt'. the presidency is also aware of the fact that in practice the moment of receipt depends on the type of communication (message, call) and the technology used. recital 15a therefore provi des some examples of such receipt, without however being exhaustive as listing all possible cases seems not to be an optimal solution for a legislative act. this would also allow the regulation to remain future proof. at the same time, since in practice th ere will probably be a need for guidance in this respect, it will be for the european data protection board to develop the respective guidelines or recommendation s. article 19 (2)(da) has therefore been added to provide for that . 8537/18 km/ek 3 dge2b en b. article 5 : confidenti ality of electronic communications data at request of several delegations, the presidency has reverted back to the original text of art. 5 , which now prohibits any 'interference' with electronic communications data. c. p ermitted processing art. 6(1)(b) now includes a reference also to 'security risks'. additional explanations have been included in recital 16 . art. 6(2)(a) provides for safeguards when processing electronic communication data for network optimisation and management. additional explanatio ns have been provided in recital 16 . processing for performance of contracts in art. 6(2)(b) has been more narrowly linked to the purposes of billing, calculating interconnection payments etc. to avoid any risk of potential abuse of this provision. the pre sidency has noted concerns by some delegations with regard to the processing to protect vital interest in art. 6(2)(d) and the preference of those delegations to revert back to the text of 'natural person physically and legally incapable of giving consent' which is in line with similar ground s under the gdpr. however , it seems that this limitation would make the provision almost unusable in practice . the presidency would like to invite delegations to reflect on the best wording of this provision . the presid ency has further amended the provisions on statistical counting in art. 6(2)(e) and (f) following a number of delegations' suggestions. in addition, in order to clarify the link between the two points, the presidency has switched the order and clarified th at point (f) comes into play only the processing is not allowed under point (e). new recital 17aa elaborates on the notion of statistical counting. moreover, following a request from a delegation, art. 6(3a)(a) now provides that special categories of perso nal data should be excluded from statistical counting in all cases. 8537/18 km/ek 4 dge2b en art. 6(3)(a) has been deleted as it was duplicating point (aa) which seems to better address the issues at stake. d. protection of end -users' terminal equipment information the wording o f art. 2(1)(b) and 3(1)(c) has been aligned with the title of art. 8. a new ground has been included in art. 8(1)(da) for security purposes. explanations related to 'cookie walls' have been further elaborated and moved from recital 21 to recital 20 . a new text in recital 21 a elaborates on the ground of information society service requested by the end -user, which does not require consent and which may encompass iot (such as connected devices) . recital 22a provides clarifications with regard to the resp onsibility for obtaining consent for cookies. e. privacy settings art. 10(2) has been further amended to reflect delegations comments that the provision should provide adequate protection without being overly burdensome. recital 24 has been amended accordi ngly. in addition it clarifies that regardless the privacy settings selected by the end -users website providers may ask the end -user for consent. new art. 10(4) provides that the provision does not apply to software that is no longer supported . new additio n in recital 23 clarifies that general privacy settings that is not sufficiently granular cannot signify consent of the end -user. 8537/18 km/ek 5 dge2b en f. publicly available directories definition of 'publicly available directory' in art. 4(3)(d) has been slightly changed for editorial purposes. art. 15(1a) and (3a) have been merged for simplification purposes. a transitional clause has been included in art. 15(4a) . g. direct marketing communications definition of 'electronic message' in art. 4(3)(e) has been further clarified. accordingly, recital 31a has been deleted as redundant. definition of 'direct marketing communications' in art. 4(3)(f) has been amended to make clear that it includes voice -to-voice calls. a correction has been made in art. 16(6)(d). additional text has been included in recital 32 to further develop the idea that art. 16 does not apply to advertisements on websites. the word 'present' has been removed throughout the text. h. supervisory authorities at the wp meeting, the presidency would like to hold a discussion on the provisions related to supervisory authorities. since there is a distinction between authorities responsible for monitoring chapter ii and those monitoring chapter iii, it is necessary, also considering the need not to lower the level of protection offered by the gdpr and the requirement s prescribed by the charter, to ensure that both authorities have the necessary means and powers to exercise their duties. the presidency has introduced new art. 18(1aa) to t hat effect but the provision will need to be further discussed and elaborated. 8537/18 km/ek 6 dge2b en i. restrictions to right and obligations under chapter i: articles 2 and 11 following the discussions in the joint meeting of wp tele and dapix (fop on data retention) of 12m february and delegations written comments provided in this connection , the presidency proposes to make the following changes: the presidency has clearly excluded, in art. 2 , activities concerning national security and defence from the scope of epr. the l ist of general public interests in art. 11(1) has been amended. references to national security and defence are no longer needed because of the changes in art. 2. the presidency has added point (i) which refers to the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others and (j) which covers the enforcement of civil law claims . in new art. 11(1a) provide specific reference to safeguards in art. 23(2) of gdpr. recital 26 has been amended accordingly. in the joint meeting of wp tele and dapix (fop on data retention) of 17 may, delegations will be invited to reflect on the proposed changes. j. other changes (in numerical order) recital 8 has been further improved based on delegations' comments. new recital 8a , inspired by recital 27 of gdpr clar ifies that epr does not apply to electronic communications data of deceased persons and leaves it to member states whether they want to regulate this issue or not. last sentence of recital 11 has been deleted as it seemed not to gather sufficient support. the word 'usually' has been replaced by 'normally' in recital 12. 8537/18 km/ek 7 dge2b en the word 'all' has been deleted in recital 15 since it raised a lot of doubts. minor change has been introduced in recital 25 . a minor change in art. 13(1a) aims at avoiding any potential conflict with art. 8(1). the text of art. 13(2) has been slightly improved. art. 19(2)(db) empowers the edpb to issue guidelines with regard to consent. 8537/18 km/ek 8 annex dge2b en annex (1) article 7 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union (\"the charter\") protects the fundamental right of everyone to the respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications. respect for the privacy of one\u2122s communications is an essential dimension of this right , applying both to natural and legal persons . confidentiality of electronic communications ensures that information exchanged between parties and the external elements of such communication, including when the information has been sent, from where, to whom, is not to be revealed to anyone other than to the parties involved in a communication. the princ iple of confidentiality should apply to current and future means of communication, including calls, internet access, instant messaging applications, e -mail, internet phone calls and personal messaging provided through social media. (2) the content of elec tronic communications may reveal highly sensitive information about the natural persons involved in the communication, from personal experiences and emotions to medical conditions, sexual preferences and political views, the disclosure of which could resul t in personal and social harm, economic loss or embarrassment. similarly, metadata derived from electronic communications may also reveal very sensitive and personal information. these metadata include s the numbers called, the websites visited, geographica l location, the time, date and duration when an individual made a call etc., allowing precise conclusions to be drawn regarding the private lives of the persons involved in the electronic communication, such as their social relationships, their habits and activities of everyday life, their interests, tastes etc. 8537/18 km/ek 9 annex dge2b en (2a a) regulation (eu) 2016/679 regulates the protection of personal data. this regulation protects in addition the respect for private life and communications. (2a) the provisions of this regula tion particularise and complement the general rules on the protection of personal data laid down in regu lation (eu) 2016/679 as regards data that qualify as personal data. this regulation therefore does not lower the level of protection enjoyed by natural persons under regulation (eu) 2016/679. the provisions particularise regulation (eu) 2016/679 by translating its principles into specific rules. if no specific rules are established in this regulation, regulation (eu) 2016/679 should apply to any processin g of data that qualify as personal data. the y provisions complement regulation (eu) 2016/679 by setting forth rules regarding subject matters that are not within the scope of regulation (eu) 2016/679 , such as the protection of the rights of end -users who are legal persons . processing of electronic communications data by providers of electronic communications services and networks should only be permitted in accordance with this regulation. insofar as end -users who are legal persons are concerned, provision s of regulation (eu) 2016/679 should apply only to the extent specifically required by this regulation. 8537/18 km/ek 10 annex dge2b en (3) electronic communications data may also reveal information concerning legal entities, such as business secrets or other sensitive information that has economic value and the protection of which allows legal persons to conduct their business, supporting among other innovation . therefore, the provisions of this regulation should in principle apply to both natural and legal persons. furthermore, this r egulation should ensure that , where necessary, provisions of the regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council 1, also apply mutatis mutandis to end -users who are legal persons. this includes the definition of provisions on consent under regulation (eu) 2016/679. when reference is made to consent by an end -user, including legal persons, this definition should apply. in addition, legal persons should have the same rights as end -users that are natural persons regarding the supervisory authorities; furthermore, supervisory authorities under this regulation should also be responsible for monitoring the application of this regulation regarding legal persons. (3a) this regulation should not affect national law regulating for instance the conclusion or the validity of a contract. similarly, this regulation should not affect national law in relation to determining who has the legal power to represent legal persons in any dealings with third parties or in legal pr oceedings. (4) pursuant to article 8(1) of the charter and article 16(1) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union, everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. regulation (eu) 2016/679 lays down rules relat ing to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. electronic communications data may include personal data as defined in regulation (eu) 2016/679. 1 regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing directive 95/46/ec (general dat a protection regulation) (oj l 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1 \u015388). 8537/18 km/ek 11 annex dge2b en (5) the provisions of this regulation particularise and complement the general rules on the protection of personal data laid down in regulation (eu) 2016/679 as regards electronic communications data that qualify as personal data. this regulation therefore does no t lower the level of protection enjoyed by natural persons under regulation (eu) 2016/679. processing of electronic communications data by providers of electronic communications services should only be permitted in accordance with this regulation. (6) whi le the principles and main provisions of directive 2002/58/ec of the european parliament and of the council 2 remain generally sound, that directive has not fully kept pace with the evolution of technological and market reality, resulting in an inconsistent or insufficient effective protection of privacy and confidentiality in relation to electronic communications. those developments include the entrance on the market of electronic communications services that from a consumer perspective are substitutable to traditional services, but do not have to comply with the same set of rules. another development concerns new techniques that allow for tracking of online behaviour of end -users, which are not covered by directive 2002/58/ec. directive 2002/58/ec should th erefore be repealed and replaced by this regulation. (7) the member states should be allowed, within the limits of this regulation, to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify and clarify the application of the rules of this regulation in order to ensure an effective application and interpretation of those rules. therefore, the margin of discretion, which member states have in this regard, should maintain a balance between the protection of private life and personal data and the free mov ement of electronic communications data. 2 directive 2002/58/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 12 july 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (d irective on privacy and electronic communications) (oj l 201, 31.7.2002, p.37). 8537/18 km/ek 12 annex dge2b en (8) this regulation should apply to providers of electronic communications services, to providers of publicly available directories, and to software providers of software permitting electronic communications, including the retrieval and presentation of information on the internet. this regulation should also apply to natural and legal persons who use electronic communications services to send or present direct marketing co mmercial communications or make use of processing and storage capabilities of terminal equipment or collect information related to processed by or emitted by or stored in end -users\u2122 terminal equipment. furthermore, this regulation should apply regardless o f whether the processing of electronic communications data or personal data of end -users who are in the union takes place in the union or not, or of whether the service provider or person processing such data is established or located in the union or not. some end -users , such as financial institutions, for example payment service providers and payment systems , process as recipients their electronic communications data for different purposes or permit other parties to process their data on their behalf. such processing may include the processing by a website information society provider, or another party on its behalf, for purposes such as ensuring network and information security , including the prevention , monitoring and termination of fraud, unauthorised access and distributed denial of service attacks, or facilitating efficient delivery of website content . such processing is not covered by this regulation. (8a) this regulation does not apply to the electronic communications data of deceased persons. member states may provide for rules regarding the processing of electronic communications data of deceased persons. (9) this regulation should apply to electronic communications data processed in connection with the provision and use of electronic communications services in the union, regardless of whether or not the processing takes place in the union. moreover, in order n ot to deprive end -users in the union of effective protection, this regulation should also apply to electronic communications data processed in connection with the provision of electronic communications services from outside the union to end -users in the un ion. 8537/18 km/ek 13 annex dge2b en (10) radio equipment and its software which is placed on the internal market in the union, must comply with directive 2014/53/eu of the european parliament and of the council 3. this regulation should not affect the applicability of any of the requi rements of directive 2014/53/eu nor the power of the commission to adopt delegated acts pursuant to directive 2014/53/eu requiring that specific categories or classes of radio equipment incorporate safeguards to ensure that personal data and privacy of end -users are protected. (11) the services used for communications purposes, and the technical means of their delivery, have evolved considerably. end -users increasingly replace traditional voice telephony, text messages (sms) and electronic mail conveyance s ervices in favour of functionally equivalent online services such as voice over ip, messaging services and web -based e -mail services. in order to ensure an effective and equal protection of end -users when using functionally equivalent services, this regula tion uses the definition of electronic communications services set forth in the [directive of the european parliament and of the council establishing the european electronic communications code 4]. that definition encompasses not only internet access servic es and services consisting wholly or partly in the conveyance of signals but also interpersonal communications services, which may or may not be number -based, such as for example, voice over ip, messaging services and web -based e -mail services. services su ch as linear broadcasting, video on demand, websites, social networks, blogs, or exchange of information between machines, should not be considered as interpersonal communications services. 3 directive 2014/53/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 16 april 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment and repealing directive 1999/5/ec (oj l 153, 22.5.2014, p. 62). 4 commission proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council establishing the european electronic communications code (recast) (com/2016/05 90 final - 2016/0288 (cod)). 8537/18 km/ek 14 annex dge2b en (11a) the protection of confidentiality of communications is cru cial also as regards interpersonal communications services that are ancillary to another service; therefore, the processing of electronic communications data in the context of the provision of such type of ancillary services also having a communication fun ctionality should be covered by this regulation. in such cases, this regulation applies only to the ancillary feature itself and the electronic communications functionality it provides. to determine whether an electronic communications functionality constitutes an ancillary feature, the end -users expectations have to be taken into account. for example such communications functionality is considered to be ancillary feature in in all the circumstances where electronic communication is taking place bet ween a finite, that is to say not potentially unlimited, number of end -users which is determined by the sender of the communications, e.g. any messaging application allowing two or more people to connect and communicate, such services constitute interperso nal communications services. conversely, a communications channel does not constitute an interpersonal communications service when it does not enable direct interpersonal and interactive exchange of information via electronic communications networks betwee n a finite number of persons, whereby the persons initiating or participating in the communication determine its recipient(s). this is for example the case when the entity providing the communications channel is at the same time a communicating party, such as a company that operates a communications channel for customer care that allows customers solely to communicate with the company in question. also, where access to an electronic communications is available for anyone, e.g. communications in an electroni c communications channel in online games which is open to all persons playing the game, such channel does not constitute an interpersonal communications feature. this reflects the end -users' expectations regarding the confidentiality of a service. 8537/18 km/ek 15 annex dge2b en (12) connected devices and machines increasingly communicate with each other by using electronic communications networks (internet of things). the use of machine -to-machine services, that is to say services involving an automated transfer of data and informati on between devices or software -based applications with limited or no human interaction, is emerging. while the services provided at the application -layer of such services do normally not qualify as an electronic communications service as defined in the [di rective establishing the european electronic communications code], tthe transmission services used for the provision of machine -to-machine communications services regularly involves the conveyance of signals over via an electronic communications network and, hence, usually normally constitutes an electronic communications service. in order to ensure full protection of the rights to privacy and confidentiality of communications, and to promote a trusted and secure internet of things in the digital single market, it is necessary to clarify that this regulation , in particular the requirements relating to the confidentiality of communications, should apply to the transmission of machine -to-machine electronic communications where carried out via an ele ctronic communications service . therefore, the principle of confidentiality enshrined in this regulation should also apply to the transmission of machine -to-machine communications. specific safeguards could also be adopted under sectorial legislation, as f or instance directive 2014/53/eu. 8537/18 km/ek 16 annex dge2b en (13) the development of fast and efficient wireless technologies has fostered the increasing availability for the public of internet access via wireless networks accessible by anyone in public and semi -private spaces suc h as 'hotspots' situated at different places within a city, department stores, shopping malls and hospitals. to the extent that those communications networks are provided to an undefined group of end -users, regardless if these networks are secured with pa sswords or not, the confidentiality of the communications transmitted through such networks should be protected. the fact that wireless electronic communications services may be ancillary to other services should not stand in the way of ensuring the protec tion of confidentiality of communications data and application of this regulation. therefore , this regulation should apply to electronic communications data using electronic communications services and public communications networks. in contrast, this regu lation should not apply to closed groups of end -users such as corporate networks, access to which is limited pre -defined group of end -users, e.g. to members of the corporation. therefore, o nly networks proving access to a group of end -users which is not pr e-defined and where end -users get access to the network under the same conditions, e.g. wifi network of a department store open to all customers, are regulated by this regulation. 8537/18 km/ek 17 annex dge2b en (14) electronic communications data should be defined in a sufficiently b road and technology neutral way so as to encompass any information concerning the content transmitted or exchanged (electronic communications content) and the information concerning an end -user of electronic communications services processed for the purpos es of transmitting, distributing or enabling the exchange of electronic communications content; including data to trace and identify the source and destination of a communication, geographical location and the date, time, duration and the type of communica tion. whether such signals and the related data are conveyed by wire, radio, optical or electromagnetic means, including satellite networks, cable networks, fixed (circuit - and packet -switched, including internet) and mobile terrestrial networks, electrici ty cable systems, the data related to such signals should be considered as electronic communications metadata and therefore be subject to the provisions of this regulation. electronic communications metadata may include information that is part of the subs cription to the service when such information is processed for the purposes of transmitting, distributing or exchanging electronic communications content. 8537/18 km/ek 18 annex dge2b en (15) electronic communications data should be treated as confidential. this means that any inter ference with the transmission processing of electronic communications data, whether directly by human intervention or through the intermediation of automated processing by machines, without the consent of all the communicating parties should be prohibited. the prohibition of interception of communications data should apply during their conveyance, i.e. until receipt of the content of the electronic communication by the intended addressee . interception of elect ronic communications data may occur, for example, when someone other than the communicating parties, listens to calls, reads, scans or stores the content of electronic communications, or the associated metadata for purposes other than the exchange of commu nications. interception also occurs when third parties monitor websites visited, timing of the visits, interaction with others, etc., without the consent of the end -user concerned. as technology evolves, the technical ways to engage in interception have al so increased. such ways may range from the installation of equipment that gathers data from terminal equipment over targeted areas, such as the so -called imsi (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, to programs and techniques that, for example , surreptitiously monitor browsing habits for the purpose of creating end -user profiles. other examples of interception include capturing payload data or content data from unencrypted wireless networks and routers, including browsing habits without the end -users' consent. (15aa) in order to ensure the confidentiality of electronic communications data, providers of electronic communications services should apply security measures in accordance with article 40 of the [directive establishing the european elect ronic communications code] and article 32 of regulation (eu) 2016/679 . moreover, trade secrets are protected in accordance with directive (eu) 2016/943. 8537/18 km/ek 19 annex dge2b en (15a) the prohibition of interception of electronic communications data content under this regulation should apply during their conveyance, i.e. until receipt of the content of the electronic communication by the intended addressee , i.e. during the end -to-end exchange of electronic communications content between end -users . the exact moment of the completio n of the transmission receipt of electronic communications content may depend on the type of electronic communications service that is provided. for instance , depending on the technology used, for a voice call the transmission will may be completed as soon as either of the end -users terminates the connection ends the call . for electronic mail or instant messaging , depending on the technology used, the transmission moment of receipt is may be completed as soon as the addressee has collected the message, typic ally from the server of the electronic communications service provider. upon completion of the transmission receipt , electronic communications content and related metadata should be erased or made anonymous by the provider of the electronic communications service except when processing is permitted under this regulation or when the end -users has entrusted the provider of the electronic communications service or another third party to record, store or otherwise process such data in accordance with regulatio n (eu) 2016/679. 8537/18 km/ek 20 annex dge2b en (16) the prohibition of processing, including storage of communications is not intended to prohibit any automatic, intermediate and transient processing, including storage of this information insofar as this takes place for the sole purp ose of carrying out the transmission in the electronic communications network. it should not prohibit either the processing of electronic communications data to ensure the security and continuity , including the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality, of the electronic communications services, including for example checking security threats such as the presence of malware or viruses, or the identification of phishing emails. spam e -mails may also affect the availability of email servic es and could potentially impact the performance of networks and e -mail services, which justifies the processing of electronic communications data to mitigate this risk. providers of electronic communications services are encouraged to offer end -users the p ossibility to check e -mails deemed as spam in order to ascertain whether they were indeed spam. or neither should it prohibit the processing of metadata to ensure the necessary quality of service requirements, such as latency, jitter etc ., nor the process ing of metadata necessary for the purpose of management or optimisation of the network . management or optimisation of the network refers to improving the performance and development of the network . nor t the processing of meta data to make it anonymous nor the processing of metadata to make it anonymou s should not be prohibited either . 8537/18 km/ek 21 annex dge2b en (17) the processing of electronic communications data can be useful for businesses, consumers and society as a whole. vis -\u00e0-vis directive 2002/58/ec, this regulation broadens the possibilities for providers of electronic communications services to process elect ronic communications metadata, based on end -users consent. however, end -users attach great importance to the confidentiality of their communications, including their online activities, and that they want to control the use of electronic communications data for purposes other than conveying the communication. therefore, this regulation should require providers of electronic communications services to obtain end -users' consent to process electronic communications metadata, which should include data on the loc ation of the device generated for the purposes of granting and maintaining access and connection to the service. location data that is generated other than in the context of providing electronic communications services should not be considered as metadata. examples of commercial usages of electronic communications metadata by providers of electronic communications services may include the provision of heatmaps; a graphical representation of data using colors to indicate the presence of individuals. to displ ay the traffic movements in certain directions during a certain period of time, an identifier is necessary to link the positions of individuals at certain time intervals. this identifier would be missing if anonymous data were to be used and such movement could not be displayed. such usage of electronic communications metadata could, for example, benefit public authorities and public transport operators to define where to develop new infrastructure, based on the usage of and pressure on the existing structu re. where a type of processing of electronic communications metadata, in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, a data protection impact assessment and, as the case may be, a consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing, in accordance with articles 35 and 36 of regulation (eu) 2016/679. 8537/18 km/ek 22 annex dge2b en (17aa) metadata that i s location data can provide valuable information, such as insights in human movement patterns and traffic patterns. such information may, for example, be used for urban planning purposes. processing for purposes of statistical counting may take place witho ut the consent of the end -users concerned, provided that certain conditions are met and safeguards are in place, including the consultation of the supervisory authority and the requirement to anonymise the result before sharing the analysis with third part ies. as end -users attach great value to the confidentiality of their communications, including their physical movements, such data cannot be used to determine the nature or characteristics on an end -user or to build a prof ile of an end -user, in order to, f or example, avoid that the data is u sed for segmentation purposes, to monitor the behaviour of a specific end -user or to draw conclusions concerning the private life of an end -user. for the same reason, the end -user must be provided with information about processing activities taking place for statistical counting and given the right to object to such processing. (17a) the processing of electronic communications metadata should also be regarded to be permitted where it is necessary in order to protect an in terest which is essential for the life of the end -users who are natural persons or that of another natural person. processing of electronic communications metadata of an end -user for the protection of the vital interest of an end -user who is a natural pers on should in principle take place only where the protection of such interests cannot be ensured without that processing. (17b) processing of electronic communication metadata for scientific research or statistical purposes should be considered to be permitted processing. this type of processing should be subj ect to further safeguards to ensure privacy of the end -users by employing appropriate security measures such as encryption and pseudonymisation. in addtion, en d-users who are natural persons should be given the right to object. 8537/18 km/ek 23 annex dge2b en (18) end -users may consent to the processing of their metadata to receive specific services such as protection services against fraudulent activities (by analysing usage data, location and customer account in real time). in the digital economy, services are oft en supplied against counter -performance other than money, for instance by end -users being exposed to advertisements. for the purposes of this regulation, consent of an end -user, regardless of whether the latter is a natural or a legal person, should have t he same meaning and be subject to the same conditions as the data subject's consent under regulation (eu) 2016/679. basic broadband internet access and voice communications services are to be considered as essential services for individuals to be able to c ommunicate and participate to the benefits of the digital economy. consent for processing electronic communications data from internet or voice communication usage will not be valid if the data subject end -user has no genuine and free choice, or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. 8537/18 km/ek 24 annex dge2b en (19) the protection of the content of electronic communications pertains to the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private and family life, home and communications protected under article 7 of the charter. any interference with the content of electronic communications should be allowed only under very clear defined conditions, for specific purposes and be subject to adequate safeguards against abuse. this regulation provides for the possibility of providers of electronic communications services to process electronic communications data in transit, with the informed consent of all the end -users concerned. for example, providers may offer services that entail the scanning of emails to remove certa in pre -defined material. given the sensitivity of the content of communications, this regulation sets forth a presumption that the processing of such content data will result in high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. when processing such type of data, the provider of the electronic communications service should always consult the supervisory authority prior to the processing. such consultation should be in accordance with article 36 (2) and (3) of regulation (eu) 2016/679. the presumption does not encompass the processing of content data to provide a service requested by the end -user where the end -user has consented to such processing and it is carried out for the purposes and duration strictly necessary and proportionate for such service. after electronic communications content has been sent by the end -user and received by the intended end -user or end -users, it may be recorded or stored by the end -user, end -users or by a third party entrusted by them to record or store such data. any proce ssing of such data must comply with regulation (eu) 2016/679. 8537/18 km/ek 25 annex dge2b en (19a) services that facilitate end -users everyday life such as index functionality, personal assistant, translation services and services that enable more inclusion for persons with disabilities such as text -to-speech services are emerging. therefore, processing electronic communications content for services explicitly requested by the end -user for their own individual use, consent should only be requested from the end -user requesting the service taking into account that the processing must be limited to that purpose, limited to the duration necessary for providing the requested services and shall not adversely affect f undamental rights and interest of another end -user concerned. (19b) providers of electronic communications services may, for example, obtain the consent of the end -user for the processing of electronic communications data, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, and any moment in time thereafter. in some cases, the legal entity having subscribed to the electronic communications service may allow a natural person, such as an employee, to make use of the service. in such case, consent needs to be o btained from the individual concerned. 8537/18 km/ek 26 annex dge2b en (20) terminal equipment of end -users of electronic communications networks and any information relating to the usage of such terminal equipment, whether in particular is stored in processed by or emitted by or stored in such equipment, requested from or processed in order to enable it to connect to another device and or network equipment, are part of the private sphere , including the privacy of one\u2122s communications, of the end -users requiring protection under the char ter of fundamental rights of the european union and the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms . given that such equipment contains or processes information that may reveal details of an individual's emotional, polit ical, social complexities, including the content of communications, pictures, the location of individuals by accessing the device\u2122s gps capabilities, contact lists, and other information already stored in the device, the information related to such equipme nt requires enhanced privacy protection. furthermore, the so -called spyware, web bugs, hidden identifiers, tracking cookies and other similar unwanted tracking tools can enter end -user's terminal equipment without their knowledge in order to gain access to information, to store hidden information and to trace the activities. information related to the end -user\u2122s device may also be collected remotely for the purpose of identification and tracking, using techniques such as the so -called \u201adevice fingerprinting \u2122, often without the knowledge of the end -user, and may seriously intrude upon the privacy of these end -users. techniques that surreptitiously monitor the actions of end -users, for example by tracking their activities online or the location of their termin al equipment, or subvert the operation of the end -users\u2122 terminal equipment pose a serious threat to the privacy of end -users. therefore, any such interference with the end -user's terminal equipment should be allowed only with the end -user's consent and fo r specific and transparent purposes . the end -user's consent to storage of a cookie or similar identifier may also entail consent for the subsequent readings of the cookie in the context of a revisit to the same website domain initially visited by the end -user. access to specific website content may still be made conditional on the consent to the storage of a cookie or similar identifier. not all cookies are needed in relation to the purpose of the provision of the website service. some are used to prov ide for additional benefits of the website operator. in some cases, making access to website content conditional to consent to the use of such cookies may be considered to be disproportionate. this is for example the case for websites providing certain ser vices, such as those provided by public authorities, where the user could be seen as having few or no other options but to use the service, and thus having no real choice as to the usage of cookies. 8537/18 km/ek 27 annex dge2b en (21) exceptions to the obligation to obtain consent to make use of the processing and storage capabilities of terminal equipment or to access information stored in terminal equipment should be limited to situations that involve no, or only very limited, intrusion of privacy. for instance, consent should not b e requested for authorizing the technical storage or access which is strictly necessary and proportionate for the legitimate purpose of enabling the use of a specific service explicitly requested by the end -user. this may include the storing of cookies for the duration of a single established session on a website to keep track of the end -user\u2122s input when filling in online forms over several pages , authentication session cookies used to verify the identity of end -users engaged in online transactions or cook ies used to remember items selected by the end -user and placed in shopping basket . access to specific website content may still be made conditional on the well -informed acceptance of the storage of a cookie or similar identifier , if it is used for a legiti mate purpose. this will for example not be the case of a cookie which is recreated after the deletion by the end -user. 8537/18 km/ek 28 annex dge2b en (21a) cookies can also be a legitimate and useful tool, for example, in assessing the effectiveness of a delivered information society service, for example of website design and advertising or by helping to measur eing web traffic to the numbers of end -users visiting a website , certain pages of a website or the number of end -users of an application. this is not the case, however, regardin g cookies and similar identifiers used to determine the nature of who is using the site . information society providers that engage in configuration checking to provide the service in compliance with the end -user's settings and the mere logging of the fact that the end -user\u2122s device is unable to receive content requested by the end -user should not constitute access to such a device or use of the device processing capabilities. consent should not be necessary either when the purpose of using the processing st orage capabilities of terminal equipment is to fix security vulnerablities and other security bugs, provided that such updates do not in any way change the functionality of the hardware or software or the privacy settings chosen by the end -user and the end -user has the possibility to postpone or turn off the automatic installation of such updates. software updates that do not exclusively have a security purpose, for example those intended to add new features to an application or improve its performance, sho uld not fall under this exception. consent should not be necessary either i f the use of processing and storage capabilities of terminal equipment and the collection of information from end -users\u2122 terminal equipment is necessary for the provision of the inf ormation society service, such as iot (for instance connected devices, such as connected thermostats) , requested by the end -user. 8537/18 km/ek 29 annex dge2b en (22) the methods used for providing information and obtaining end -user's consent should be as user -friendly as possible. given the ubiquitous use of tracking cookies and other tracking techniques, end -users are increasingly requested to provide consent to store such tracking cookies in their terminal equipment. as a result, end -users are overloaded with requests to provide consent. the use of technical means to provide consent, for example, through transparent and user -friendly settings, may address this problem . therefore, this regulation should provide for the possibility to express consent by using the appropriate settings of a browser or other application. the choices made by end -users when establishing its general privacy settings of a browser or other appli cation should be binding on, and enforceable against, any third parties. (22a) web browsers are a type of software application that permits the retrieval and presentation of information on the internet . other types of applications, such as the ones that p ermit calling and messaging or provide route guidance, have also the same capabilities . web browsers mediate much of what occurs between the end -user and the website. from this perspective, they are in a privileged the position to play an active role to he lp the end -user to control the flow of information to and from the terminal equipment. more particularly web browsers may be used as gatekeepers, thus helping end -users to prevent information from their terminal equipment (for example smart phone, tablet o r computer) from being accessed or stored. the responsibility for obtaining consent with the storage of a cookie and for any penalties for breach of duty lies on the information society service provider. 8537/18 km/ek 30 annex dge2b en (23) the principles of data protection by design and by default were codified under article 25 of regulation (eu) 2016/679. currently, the default settings for cookies are set in most current browsers to \u201aaccept all cookies\u2122. therefore providers of software enabling the retrieval and presentation of info rmation on the internet should have an obligation to configure the software so that it offers the option to prevent third parties from storing information on the terminal equipment; this is often presented as \u201areject third party cookies\u2122. end -users should be offered a set of privacy setting options, ranging from higher (for example, \u201anever accept cookies\u2122) to lower (for example, \u201aalways accept cookies\u2122) and intermediate (for example, \u201areject third party cookies\u2122 or \u201aonly accept first party cookies\u2122). such p rivacy settings should be presented offered in a an easily visible and intelligible manner. general privacy settings that do not provide the end -user with information about the purpose for which information can be stored on the terminal equipment, or infor mation already stored on that equipment can be processed, as a consequence of the configured privacy settings , cannot signify the end -user's consent to the storing of information on the terminal equipment or the processing of information already stored on that equipment. 8537/18 km/ek 31 annex dge2b en (24) for web browsers to be able to obtain end -users\u2122 consent as defined under regulation (eu) 2016/679, for example, to the storage of third party tracking cookies, they should, among others, require a clear affirmative action from the e nd-user of terminal equipment to signify his or her freely given, specific informed, and unambiguous agreement to the storage and access of such cookies in and from the terminal equipment. such action may be considered to be affirmative, for example, if en d-users are required to actively select \u201aaccept third party cookies\u2122 to confirm their agreement and are given the necessary information to make the choice. to this end, it it is necessary to require providers of software enabling access to internet that, a t the moment of installation or first use and at the moment of every update that change the privacy settings , end -users are informed about the possibility to choose the available privacy settings among the various options and ask them to make a choice . information provided should not dissuade end -users from selecting higher privacy settings and should include relevant information about the default setting and about the risks associated with the different privacy settings, including those related to allow ing third party cookies to be stored in the computer, including the compilation of long -term records of individuals' browsing histories and the use of such records to send targeted advertising . updates of software enabling access to internet should not alt er the privacy settings selected by the end -user. web browsers are encouraged to provide easy ways for end -users to change the privacy settings at any time during use and to allow the user to make exceptions for or to whitelist certain websites or to speci fy for which websites (third) party cookies are always or never allowed. this regulation does not prevent website providers from requesting the consent of the end -user for the use of cookies irrespective of the privacy setting selected by the end -user. 8537/18 km/ek 32 annex dge2b en (25) accessing electronic communications networks requires the regular emission of certain data packets in order to discover or maintain a connection with the network or other devices on the network. furthermore, devices must have a unique address assigned i n order to be identifiable on that network. wireless and cellular telephone standards similarly involve the emission of active signals containing unique identifiers such as a mac address, the imei (international mobile station equipment identity), the imsi , the wifi signal etc. a single wireless base station (i.e. a transmitter and receiver), such as a wireless access point, has a specific range within which such information may be captured. service providers have emerged who offer physical movements' track ing services based on the scanning of equipment related information with diverse functionalities, including people counting, such as providing data on the number of people waiting in line, ascertaining the number of people in a specific area, etc referred to as statistical counting for which the consent of end -users is not needed, provided that such counting is limited in time and space to the extent necessary for this purpose. providers should also apply appropriate technical and organisations measures to ensure the level if security appropriate to the risks, including pseudonymisation of the data and making it anonymous or erase it as soon it is not longer needed for this purpose . providers engaged in such practices should display prominent notices located on the edge of the area of coverage informing end -users prior to entering the defined area that the technology is in operation within a given perimeter, the purpose of the tracking, the person responsible for it and the existence of any measure the end -user of the terminal equipment can take to minimize or stop the collection. additional information should be provided where personal data are collected pursuant to article 13 of regulation (eu) 2016/679. this information may be used for more intrusive purpos es, which should not be considered statistical counting, such as to send commercial messages to end -users, for example when they enter stores, with personalized offers locations , subject to the conditions laid down in this regulation , . while some of thes e functionalities do not entail high privacy risks, others do, for example, those involving as well as the tracking of individuals over time, including repeated visits to specified locations. providers engaged in such practices should display prominent not ices located on the edge of the area of coverage informing end -users prior to entering the defined area that the technology is in operation within a given perimeter, the purpose of the tracking, the person responsible for it and the existence of any measur e the end -user of the terminal equipment can take to minimize or stop the collection. additional information should be 8537/18 km/ek 33 annex dge2b en provided where personal data are collected pursuant to article 13 of regulation (eu) 2016/679. (26) when the processing of electronic com munications data by providers of electronic communications services falls within its scope, this regulation should provide for the possibility for the union or member states under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when s uch a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific public interests, including national security, defence, public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of crimina l offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and other important objectives of general public interest of the union or of a member state, in particular an important e conomic or financial interest of the union or of a member state, or a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected to the exercise of official authority for such interests. therefore, this regulation should not affect the ability of member state s to carry out lawful interception of electronic communications or take other measures, if necessary and proportionate to safeguard the public interests mentioned above, in accordance with the charter of fundamental rights of the european union and the eur opean convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as interpreted by the court of justice of the european union and of the european court of human rights. providers of electronic communications services should provide for appropr iate procedures to facilitate legitimate requests of competent authorities, where relevant also taking into account the role of the representative designated pursuant to article 3(3). 8537/18 km/ek 34 annex dge2b en (27) as regards calling line identification, it is necessary to protect the right of the calling party to withhold the presentation of the identification of the line from which the call is being made and the right of the called party to reject calls from unidentified lines. certain end -users, in particular help lines, and sim ilar organisations, have an interest in guaranteeing the anonymity of their callers. as regards connected line identification, it is necessary to protect the right and the legitimate interest of the called party to withhold the presentation of the identifi cation of the line to which the calling party is actually connected. (28) there is justification for overriding the elimination of calling line identification presentation in specific cases. end -users' rights to privacy with regard to calling line identification should be restricted where this is necessary to trace malicious or nuisance calls and with regard to calling line identification and location data where this is necessary to allow emergency services, such as ecall, to carry out their tasks as effectively as possible. location information established by the terminal equipm ent, using its built -in global navigation satellite systems (gnss) capabilities or other types of terminal equipment based location data, such as location data derived from the wifi functionality , may supplement the location data supplied by providers of number -based interpersonal communications services when a call is made to emergency services. the temporary denial or absence of consent of an end -user to access location data provided by the terminal equipment gnss, for example, because location settings are turned off, shall not prevent the transfer of such information to emergency services for the purposes of facilitating access to such services. directive 2014/53/eu empowers the commission to adopt delegated acts requiring that specific categories or classes of radio equipment support certain features ensuring access to emergency services. 8537/18 km/ek 35 annex dge2b en (29) technology exists that enables providers of electronic communications services to limit the reception of unwanted, malicious or nuisance calls by end -users in different ways, including blocking silent calls and other fraudulent unwanted, malicious and nuisance calls , such as calls originating from invalid numbers, i.e. numbers that do not exist in the numbering plan, valid numbers that are not allocated to a pr ovider of a number -based interpersonal communications service, and valid numbers that are allocated but not assigned to an end -user . providers of publicly available number -based interpersonal communications services should deploy this technology and protec t end -users against nuisance such calls and free of charge. providers should ensure that end -users are aware of the existence of such functionalities, for instance, by publicising the fact on their webpage. (30) publicly available directories of end -users of electronic communications services are widely distributed. publicly available directories means any directory or service containing categories of information on end -users information personal data of number -based interpersonal communication services such as name, phone numbers (including mobile phone numbers), email address contact details , home address and includes inquiry services, the main function of which is to enable to identify such end -users . the right to privacy and to protection of the perso nal data of a natural person requires that end -users that are natural persons are asked for consent before their personal data are included in a directory able to determine per category of personal data whether their personal data are included in a director y. the legitimate interest of legal entities persons requires that end -users that are legal entities persons have the right to object to the data related to them being included in a directory. end -users who are natural persons acting in a professional capa city should be treated as legal persons for the purpose of the provisions on publicly available directories . 8537/18 km/ek 36 annex dge2b en (31) if end -users that are natural persons give their consent to their data being included in such directories, they should be able to determine on a consent basis which categories of personal data are included in the directory (for example name, email address, home address, user name, phone number). in addition, p providers of publicly available directories number -based interpersonal communications services and/or providers of publicly available directories should inform the end -users who are natural persons of the purposes of the directory and of the search functions of the directory and obtain their additional consent before including them in that directory enabling such search functions related to their personal data . end -users should be able to determine by consent on the basis of which categories of personal data their contact details can be searched. the categories of personal data included in the directory and the categories of personal data on the basis of which the end -user's contact details can be searched should not necessarily be the same. (31a) for the purposes of the provisions relating to direct marketing communications, electronic message should include e -mail, sms, mms and functionally equivalent applications and techniques. (32) in this regulation, direct marketing communications refers to any form of advertising by which a natural or legal person sends or presents direct marketi ng communications directly to one or more identified or identifiable end -users using electronic communications services. the provisions on direct marketing communications do not apply to any other form of marketing, e.g. displaying advertising to the gener al public on a website which is not directed to any specific identified or identifiable end -user and do not require any contact details about the end -user. an identified or identifiable end -user is the user that has logged in with a private account or pers onal log -in. in addition to the offering of products and services for commercial purposes, member states may decide that this should direct marketing communications also may include messages sent by political parties that contact natural persons via electr onic communications services in order to promote their parties. the same should appl yies to messages sent by other non -profit organisations to support the purposes of the organisation. 8537/18 km/ek 37 annex dge2b en (33) safeguards should be provided to protect end -users against unsolicited direct marketing communications for direct marketing purposes , which intrude into the private life privacy of end -users. the degree of privacy intrusion and nuisance is considered relatively similar independently of the wide range of technologi es and channels used to conduct these electronic communications, whether using automated calling and communication systems , instant messaging applications, emails, sms, mms, bluetooth, etc. it is therefore justified to require that consent of the end -user s who are natural persons is obtained before commercial electronic communications for direct marketing communications purposes are sent or presented to end -users them in order to effectively protect individuals them against the intrusion into their private life as well as the legitimate interest of legal persons . legal certainty and the need to ensure that the rules protecting against unsolicited electronic direct marketing communications remain future -proof justify the need to define in principle a single s et of rules that do not vary according to the technology used to convey these unsolicited direct marketing communications, while at the same time guaranteeing an equivalent level of protection for all citizens throughout the union. however, it is reasonabl e to allow the use of e-mail contact details for electronic message within the context of an existing customer relationship for the offering of similar products or services. such possibility should only apply to the same company that has obtained the elect ronic contact details for electronic message in accordance with regulation (eu) 2016/679. (3633a)voice -to-voice direct marketing calls that do not involve the use of automated calling and communication systems , given that they are more costly for the sender and impose no financial costs on end -users. member states should therefore be able to establish and or maintain national systems only allowing such calls to end -users who are natural persons and who have not objected. 8537/18 km/ek 38 annex dge2b en (34) when end -users who are natural persons have provided their consent to receiving unsolicited direct marketing communications for direct marketing purposes , they should still be able to withdraw their consent at any time in an easy manner and without any cost to them . to facilitate effective enforcement of union rules on unsolicited messages for direct marketing communications , it is necessary to prohibit the masking of the identity and the use of false identities, false return addresses or numbers while s ending or presenting unsolicited commercial direct marketing communications for direct marketing purposes . unsolicited direct marketing communications should therefore be clearly recognizable as such and should indicate the identity of the legal or the nat ural person transmitting sending or presenting the communication or on behalf of whom the communication is transmitted sent or presented and provide the necessary information for recipients end -users who are natural persons to exercise their right to oppose withdraw their consent to receiving further written and/or oral marketing messages direct marketing communications, such as valid contact details (e.g. link, e -mail address) which can be easily used by end -users who are natural persons to withdraw their consent free of charge . (35) in order to allow easy withdrawal of consent, legal or natural persons conducting direct marketing communications by email should present a link, or a valid electronic mail address, which can be easily used by end -users to wit hdraw their consent. legal or natural persons conducting direct marketing communications through voice -to-voice calls and through calls by automating calling and communication systems should display present their identity line on which the company can be c alled . member states are encouraged to introduce by means of national law or present a specific code or prefix identifying the fact that the call is a direct marketing call to improve the tools provided for the end -users in order to protect their privacy i n more efficient manner . using a specific code or prefix should not relieve the legal or natural persons sending or presenting direct marketing call from the obligation to present their calling line identification. 8537/18 km/ek 39 annex dge2b en (37) service providers who offer electronic communications services should inform end - users of measures they can take to protect the security of their communications for instance by using specific types of software or encryption technologies. the requirement to inform end -users of partic ular security risks does not discharge a service provider from the obligation to take, at its own costs, appropriate and immediate measures to remedy any new, unforeseen security risks and restore the normal security level of the service. the provision of information about security risks to the subscriber should be free of charge. security is appraised in the light of article 32 of regulation (eu) 2016/679 .
