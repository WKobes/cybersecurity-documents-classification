2. notes that the outcome of the enp review will provide a basis for a serious discussion in 2016 on how, in the case of the three eastern european partners that have association agreements, a differentiated approach can be translated in practice; 3. shares the view that the eu and its partner countries face multiple and simultaneous challenges to their security , the nature of which is more and more complex, in an environment characterised by a globalised economy, climate change, international mobility, digitalisation, demographic shifts and migrations, and the threats posed both by traditional state actors and by non-state organisations supporting terrorism or international crime;

9. takes the view that dealing with refugees, displaced persons and migratory flows requires a common and holistic approach to foreign and migration policies, encompassing development, conflict prevention and settlement, crisis management, burden-sharing, humanitarian aid and joint endeavours to alleviate burdens;

urges the eu members states concerned to cease all cooperation with the company gazprom on the gas pipeline project nord stream 2; 22. is concerned by the risk of military incidents in europe, where russia and nato have recently deployed further military forces and equipment, in particular in eastern europe, in the black sea basin, in the countries on the baltic sea and in the artic sea region;

calls on the eu and its partners to cooperate in expanding economic ties with iran, and to identify \u2014 and possibly initiate \u2014 new projects of common interest, especially in the transport and energy fields; increasing engagement in the middle east and north africa 29. stresses that there are a number of very serious and interconnected problems of political, economic, social and environmental nature that have destabilised the countries of the middle east and africa;

32. calls on the eu and its partner countries to do their utmost to influence the parties concerned to bring an end to the civil war in syria and to prepare for a political solution; believes that isil/da'esh and other un-designated terrorist groups must not have any ruling role in the post-war era or in the political future of syria; takes the view that the protection of civilians in syria must be a priority for the international community and calls, therefore, on the conflicting parties to stop disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, including shelling, targeting civilian areas and preventing humanitarian relief from reaching civilians in conflict zones; 33. notes that the targeting of civilians, and the human right violations, in syria have contributed to the rise of terrorist groups, in particular isil/da'esh; considers that isil/da'esh poses a threat to international peace and security , and that it has dramatically undermined stability in iraq, syria and the broader middle east, being responsible for systematic abuses of human rights and violations of international law, including deliberate killings of civilians and the persecution of individuals and entire communities, along with numerous other atrocities; welcomes the commitment of the international coalition partners to pursue their effort to counter isil/da'esh; 34. takes the view that it is of the utmost importance for the stability of the whole middle east to relaunch the peace process of the israeli-palestinian conflict with a view to reaching a lasting comprehensive settlement respectful of international law and based on the two-state principle; developing cooperation for security and defence 35. notes that external and internal threats to security have become more interdependent and complex, and thus more difficult to predict; points in particular to the hybrid threats involving the use of military and non-military means, ranging from intelligence, political subversion and disinformation to cyber -attacks and economic pressures;

supports the development of cooperation activities between the eu and its partner countries on security and defence issues, in particular within the framework of the eastern partnership panel on cooperation in this area;

stresses the important need of judiciary and police cooperation, for instance through europol and eurojust; 37. welcomes the new focus of the reviewed enp, and welcomes as well the eu's intention to step up cooperation with its partner countries in the fields of conflict prevention, counter-terrorism, anti-radicalisation, organised crime, border management and ssr; takes the view that such cooperation needs to be substantial, to aim at addressing common security threats and to hasten the development of joint efforts to promote viable settlement of conflicts, including through enhanced participation in csdp missions and training activities, as well as through actions to ensure the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to combat the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons; 38. believes that, in particular, closer cooperation is needed to increase knowledge of the eu concepts on ssr in partner countries; calls on the eu and its member states to support partner countries further in conducting reforms, building proper state institutions and implementing good practices to deal with security issues, such as crisis management and intelligence;

believes that there should be closer cooperation among the eastern european partner countries in order to put in place a strong foundation to ensure regional integration; pursuing engagement in disarmament and mitigating risks of weapon proliferation and trafficking 43. calls on the eu, its member states and the partner countries to pursue actively their efforts to promote the universality of multilateral disarmament treaties; urges the eu and its member states to exploit, in a better way, the potential to promote and support joint disarmament operations involving partner countries; 44. calls for stronger focus on the role of arms control within security policy and on fighting illegal arms trade;

calls, therefore, on the eu member states and the partner countries to strengthen cooperation between their national law enforcement bodies in fighting terrorism, transnational and cross-border crime, such as human trafficking \u2014 in particular the trafficking of women and children, and of drugs, arms and cultural goods \u2014 and economic crime and cybercrime; encourages the partner countries to reinvigorate cooperation among themselves in these fields, under regional formats; 48. urges the eu, its member states and the partner countries to approach their policies on countering terrorism at home and abroad in a streamlined manner; recommends, in particular, that they tackle the underlying roots of home-grown terrorism (such as political and religious extremism), stem recruitment in terrorist organisations and eradicate incitement to terrorists attacks; calls for full use of the eu's foreign and development policies to combat poverty, discrimination and marginalisation, to fight corruption, to promote good governance and to prevent and resolve conflicts \u2014 as those elements are indispensable for keeping vulnerable groups of society away from extremist propaganda;
