'tools' would typically mean a physical device and/or software/algorithm used to increase the security of ict systems. exampl es would be intrusion detection software or data resources allowing situational awareness of critical infrastructures. the competence centre proposal allows all sorts of procurement, not only joint procurement: by the competence centre as a union body, by others with the help of a union grant, or by several parties . 13243/18 km/ek 22 annex tree.2.b en specific objective 5 - deployment, best use of digital capacity and interoperability 5.1 take -up of digital public services 5.2 enterprises with high digital intensity score 5.3 alignment of the national interoperability framework with the european interoperability framework 5.4 number of businesses and public authorities which have used the digital innovation hubs\u2122 services. 13243/18 km/ek 23 annex tree.2.b en annex 3 synergies with other union programmes 31. synergies with horizon europe shall ensure that: (a) whereas several thematic areas addressed by digital europe and horizon europe converge, the type of actions to be supported, their expected outputs and their intervention logic are different and complementary; (b) horizon europe will provide extensive sup port to research, technological development, demonstration, piloting, proof -of-concept, testing and innovation including pre -commercial deployment of innovative digital technologies, in particular through (i) a dedicated budget in the global challenges pil lar for \"digital and industry\" to develop enabling technologies (artificial intelligence and robotics, next generation internet, high performance computing and big data, key digital technologies, combining digital with other technologies); (ii) support to e-infrastructures under the open science pillar; (iii) the integration of digital across all the global challenges (health, security, energy and mobility, climate, etc.); and (iv) support for scale -up breakthrough innovations under the open innovation pill ar (many of which will combine digital and physical technologies); (c) digital europe will invest in (i) digital capacity building in high performance computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and advanced digital skills; and (ii) national and regi onal deployment within an eu framework of digital capacities and the latest digital technologies in areas of public interest (such as health, public administration, justice and education) or market failure (such as the digitisation of businesses, notably s mall and medium enterprises); (d) digital europe capacities and infrastructures are made available to the research and innovation community, including for activities supported through horizon europe including testing, experimentation and demonstration acro ss all sectors and disciplines; (e) as the development of novel digital technologies matures through horizon europe, these will progressively be taken up and deployed by digital europe; (f) horizon europe initiatives for the development of skills and compe tencies curricula, including those delivered at the co -location centres of the european institute of innovation and technology's kic -digital, are complemented by digital europe -supported capacity -building in advanced digital skills; (g) strong coordination mechanisms for programming and implementation, are put in place, aligning all procedures for both programmes to the extent possible. their governance structures will involve all commission concerned services. 13243/18 km/ek 24 annex tree.2.b en 42. synergies with union programmes under shared management, including the european regional development fund (erdf), the european social fund plus (esf+), the european agricultural fund for rural development (eafrd) and european maritime and fisheries fund (e mff), shall ensure that: (a) arrangements for complementary funding from union programmes under shared management and the digital europe programme are used to support activities providing a bridge between smart specialisations and support to the digital t ransformation of the european economy and society . (b) the erdf contributes to the development and strengthening of regional and local innovation ecosystems , and industrial transformation as well as digital transformation of society and of public administr ation . this includes support to digitization of industry and take -up of results as well as the rolling out of novel technologies and innovative solutions. moreover, this support should stimulate implementation of the tallinn declaration on egovernment ref lecting digital transformation in a greater scale. the digital europe programme will complement and support the trans -national networking and mapping of digital capacities to make them accessible to smes and to make interoperable it solutions accessible to all eu regions. 53. synergies with the connecting europe facility (cef) shall ensure that: (a) the future dep focuses on large -scale digital capacity and infrastructure building in high performance computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and adv anced digital skills aiming at wide uptake and deployment across europe of critical existing or tested innovative digital solutions within an eu framework in areas of public interest or market failure. dep is mainly implemented through coordinated and stra tegic investments with member states, notably through joint public procurement, in digital capacities to be shared across europe and in eu -wide actions that support interoperability and standardisation as part of developing a digital single market. (b) dig ital europe capacities and infrastructures are made available to the deployment of innovative new technologies and solutions in the field of mobility and transport. the cef supports the roll -out and deployment of innovative new technologies and solutions i n the field of mobility and transport. (c) coordination mechanisms will be established in particular through appropriate governance structures. 13243/18 km/ek 25 annex tree.2.b en 64. synergies with investeu shall ensure that: (a) support through market -based financing, including pursuing policy objectives under this programme will be provided under the investeu fund regulation. such market -based financing might be combined with the grant support. (b) access to financial instruments by companies will be facilitated by the support provided b y digital innovation hubs. 75. synergies with erasmus shall ensure that: (a) the programme will support the development and acquisition of the advanced digital skills needed for the deployment of cutting -edge technologies such as artificial intelligence o r high -performance computing, in cooperation with relevant industries. (b) the advanced skills part of erasmus will complement the interventions of digital europe addressing the acquisition of skills in all domains and at all levels, through mobility exper iences. 6. synergies with other eu programmes and initiatives on competences/skills shall be ensured.", "document_date": "18/10/2018", "publication_date": "18/10/2018", "order_id": 1693, "document_type": "Note", "title": "Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Digital Europe programme for the period 2021-2027 - Examination of the Presidency text", "most_common_words": {"programme": 43, "with": 73, "been": 32, "by": 41, "european": 50, "digital": 44, "article": 62, "shall": 78, "annex": 35, "union": 36}, "word_counts": {"cyber security": 0, "protection": 2, "digital technologies": 4, "security": 22, "surveillance systems": 0, "cybercrime": 0, "digitalisation": 0, "egovernment": 1, "information security": 0, "ict": 5, "internet": 1, "cyber attack": 0, "internet of things": 0, "cloud": 0, "personal data": 0, "digital": 46, "hacker": 0, "cybersecurity": 7, "digital age": 0, "big data": 1, "data protection": 0, "ddos": 0, "cyber": 8, "privacy": 0}}
