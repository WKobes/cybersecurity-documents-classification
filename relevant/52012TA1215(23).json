whether due to fraud or error, and for ensuring that the transactions underlying those accounts are legal and regular. the auditor\u2019s responsibility 5. the court\u2019s responsibility is to provide, on the basis of its audit, the european parliament and the council ( 11 ) with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the annual accounts of the agency and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them. 6. the court conducted its audit in accordance with the ifac international standards on auditing and codes of ethics and the intosai international standards of supreme audit institutions. these standards require that the court plans and performs the audit to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the annual accounts of the agency are free of material misstatement and the transactions underlying them are legal and regular. 7. an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them. the procedures are selected based on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the accounts and of material non-compliance of the underlying transactions with the requirement of the legal framework of the european union, whether due to fraud or error. in assessing those risks, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the accounts and supervisory and control systems implemented to ensure legality and regularity of underlying transactions, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the accounts. 8. the court considers that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the opinions set out below. opinion on the reliability of the accounts 9. in the court\u2019s opinion, the agency\u2019s annual accounts ( 12 ) present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as of 31 december 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the commission\u2019s accounting officer ( 13 ) . opinion on the legality and the regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts 10. in the court\u2019s opinion, the transactions underlying the annual accounts of the agency for the financial year ended 31 december 2011 are legal and regular in all material respects. 11. the comments which follow do not call the court\u2019s opinions into question. comments on budgetary and financial management 12. as in 2010, the agency\u2019s budget amounted to 8,1 million euro. budget implementation improved as compared with the previous year. however, total appropriations carried over to 2012 amount to 1,1 million euro. for title ii (administrative expenditure) 0,2 million euro (34 %) and for title iii (operational expenditure) 0,8 million euro (33 %) of appropriations were carried forward. this high level of carry over is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality. comments on key controls of the agency\u2019s supervisory and control systems 13. the court identified the need to improve the documentation of fixed assets. purchases of fixed assets are recorded at invoice and not at item level. when several new assets are covered by one single invoice, there is only one entry for all the purchased assets and the total amount. other comments 14. the agency needs to improve the transparency of recruitment procedures. no adequate measures were taken to address the lack of transparency reported by the court in 2010. the thresholds candidates had to meet in order to be invited to interview, the questions for written tests and interviews and their weightings were not prepared before the examination of the applications. threshold scores for being put on a list of suitable candidates were not established before the examination of applications. this report was adopted by chamber iv, headed by dr louis galea, member of the court of auditors, in luxembourg at its meeting

improving cooperation the principal goal of the first work stream was to support the european commission and the member states in building on current cooperation schemes to intensify the exchange of information and cooperation between member states. this includes providing data and opinions to the commission in order to assist them in drafting new regulation as well as the identification and promotion of good practice in support of such legislation. this work fed into and takes into account the discussions at the european forum for member states (efms) and the european public private partnership for resilience (ep3r). the problems to be solved havebeen described in other documents, notably the european commission\u2018s communications on security (com 2006 251), the ciip (com 2009 149), which highlighted the importance of network and information security and resilience for the creation of a single european information space, and the digital agenda. as interdependencies become complex, a disruption in one infrastructure can easily propagate across boundaries (geographical and jurisdictional) as well as into other infrastructures and have a european-wide impact. the global nature of telecommunication business requires a common approach to deal with issues such as resilience and security of public communication networks. number of deliverables: 13 ws2 \u2013 improving pan-european ciip ( 2 ) & resilience the objective of work stream 2 is to assist member states in implementing secure and resilient ict systems and to increase the level of protection of critical information infrastructures and services in europe. this work stream is closely aligned with the ciip action plan described in the commission\u2019s communication of march 2009 and of march 2011. much of this work also directly supports objectives laid down in the internal security strategy document as well as the digital agenda. work packages in the area of ciip are, for the most part, a natural continuation of work carried out as part of the work programme of 2010. more specifically, the objectives of this work stream are: \u2014 to enhance the operational capabilities of member states by helping relevant stakeholders to increase their level of efficiency and effectiveness \u2014 to support and promote exercises on a pan-european level \u2014 to identify and address the information security challenges in ciip \u2014 to identify and address information security issues in ict and interconnected networks \u2014 to support to the eu-u.s. working group on cyber - security and cyber -crime established in the context of the eu-u.s. summit of 20 november 2010. number of deliverables: 16 ws3: the agency as promoter of privacy & trust ws3 comprised of four work packages (wpk): \u2014 understanding and analysing economic incentives and barriers to information security . \u2014 ensuring that privacy, identity and trust are correctly integrated into new services. \u2014 supporting the implementation of article 4 of the eprivacy directive (2002/58/ec). \u2014 promoting the establishment of a european cyber security month. the first wpk analysed the economic barriers and incentives for improving information security at the pan-european level. the agency analysed economic drivers and barriers in legal, policy, technical and educational areas and identified potential improvements. the second wpk examined how privacy, identity and trust are integrated into new services, proposing recommendations for improvements. the goal was to assess and evaluate current developments in protecting the privacy of individuals and in enhancing the level of trust in network services. the third wpk covered the support that the agency provided for the implementation of article 4 of the eprivacy directive. this was a continuation of the collaboration with art.29, the edps as well the european commission (dgs just and infso) and aimed at investigating how to practically implement at eu level the provisions of article 4. finally, the agency collaborated with member states on the organisation of a european cybersecurity month. number of deliverables: 5
