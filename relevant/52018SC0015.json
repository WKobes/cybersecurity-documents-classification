initiative on standardisation action 1 \u2013 study on the economic and societal impacts of standardisation in the eu and efta member states. scope and objectives even though it is generally acknowledged that standards play an important part, there is a clear need of better understanding their economic and broader societal impact. also, the impa cts of standards within businesses and their supply chains are less well understood. the same applies for the public sector, not always being well aware and informed about the impact of using standards in public policies. therefore, as already requested by the compet council in 2015 1 , the first action calls for launching a study to analyse the economic and societal impact of european standardisation on a eu and efta ms level. the study has also been announced in the annual union work programme for european standardisation for 2017 (auwp 2017) 2 . participants the commission with support from efta and in co-operation with national standards bodies and other participants to the jis. state of play the commission launched a survey between the jis participants on 30 september 2016 asking for possible definitions of the topics that could be covered under the study, on possible data resources and assumptions about relations between standards and other economic and societal variables. the results were presented at the jis steering group of 13 december 2016. furthermore, a roundtable was organised on 16 may 2017 with academia and scientists to exchange views on various research methodologies and existing reports. the commission proceeded by launching a call under a low value contract to perform a feasibility study (max. 6 months) which is foreseen to start in october 2017. the outcomes of this assessment will inform the broader decision by the european commission to launch a study, or other suitable instrument, on the economic and societal impact of standards and standardisation on an eu and efta ms level. action 2 \u2013 linking research and innovation with standardisation scope and objectives it is important to highlight the link between research, innovation and commercialisation using standardisation as early as possible in order to exploit to a maximum the outcomes of current and future research and innovation projects from, for example, horizon2020 or from other existing innovation related initiatives and networks (the european technology platforms (etp), joint technology initiatives (jti), public-private partnerships (ppp), and european innovation partnerships (eip). in fact, about 30% of horizon2020 projects have a direct or indirect link to pre-normative activities. an early in-depth analysis should be carried out of where, when and how standardisation can help to boost innovation in european innovation programs. it would also be helpful to increase the use of standards by business to foster market access for their innovation. those standardisation deliverables supporting research and innovation projects that have been realised so far will be assessed and the development of pilot projects may also be taken into consideration. participants the action is led by joint research center in close collaboration with cen and cenelec, as well as with the commission services (cnect and grow). the sponsors of the action include also the commission (cnect), etsi, the cost association, eight nsbs, euramet and one industry association. state of play the action group prepared a roadmap with the objective to establish a sustainable system that encourages the natural cooperation between researchers and innovators with the european standardisation system, and allows for the smooth uptake of research and innovation outputs into standardisation. the roadmap contains four sets of actions: \u00a7 to further develop and exploit foresight mechanisms : exploit foresight mechanisms to identify challenges, and subsequently integrate research and sta ndardization to address those challenges \u00a7 to deepen research \u2013 standardisation integration : facilitate the transfer of research and innovation to the market through standardization) \u00a7 to introduce standardisation in the european innovation eco-system: build a strong network of innovation actors to raise awareness of standardization) \u00a7 coordination, dissemination and reporting. action 3 \u2013 programmes for education in standardisation/training and awareness on standardisation scope and objectives the importance of standardisation for competiveness and economic growth is undisputed. smart, innovation-friendly eu and national legislation makes increasingly use of standards. however, on eu level neither formal education nor vocational training address standardisation consistently in view of offering the development of related competences . t his action will develop a concise set of recommendations and strategic advice regarding the education about standardisation (eas) in europe. the action will look at programmes of formal education and vocational training addressing standardisation on a strategic level, including education on the european standardisation system. the action will look at ways how to explore and promote standardisation as an element of formal education, academic and vocational training, in co-operation with member states with experience in this area, as well as engaging academia and other stakeholders. a training programme for policy officers of the european and efta institutions (and experts on standardisation) will also be considered. participants action 3 \u2013 lead: bitkom (co-lead \"industry\") and euras, the european academy for standardisation (co-lead \"academia\") \u2013 sponsors and contributors: 3 eu ms, 3 esos, 1 university, 1 industrial association, european commission associated: 1 technical university, 1 societal stakeholder organisation state of play the action consists of two major project parts, (a) standardisation as element of formal education (hereinafter referred to as education on standards - \"eas\") and (b) the design of a standardisation-related training programme for ec and efta institutions officials were confirmed. as high level objectives were defined: \u00b7 promote the strategic relevance of standardisation/standards to leaders of universi ties (non-technical faculties) and business schools and trigger the development of related educational programmes \u00b7 trigger a better articulation to and representation of the need of business for eas \u00b7 develop recommendations and a strategic roadmap outlining the further progress in eas in europe. the operational targets are \u00b7 programmes on eas (identification & collection) \u00b7 studies on need for eas (identification & analysis) \u00b7 institutions active in eas (identification & reach out) \u00b7 awareness raising \u00b7 eas teaching material (identification & collection, specific development) \u00b7 eas training programme for ec and efta officials these operational targets are further defined in work packages with specific deliverables and tasks. a number of activities are already ongoing: \u00b7 ec commissioned two assessments in order to provide the evidence basis for this project: the \"market need for standardisation competence\" (delivery of final report: 30.9.2017) and \"the role of european universities as sta ndardisation-related education supplier\" (awarded: september 2017); \u00b7 ec has awarded to etsi a grant for developing academic teaching materials for ict-standardisation (may 2017: validation workshop for teaching material on ict standardisation for universi ties, delivery scheduled for end 2018); \u00b7 a roundtable between ec and european academia (may 2017) reached out to academia active in researching into and teaching standardisation to exchange views on programmes on eas and their integration in academic teachi ng; \u00b7 all sponsors contribute to the different wps and take leadership ; \u00b7 action 3 formally called upon industry, their associations, to join the work considering that at the end industry is the main beneficiary \u2013 a respective joint mail was addressed to the sc of the jis action 4 \u2013 improvement of standardisation awareness in national public authorities. scope and objectives at national level, a certain lack of knowledge about the role of standards in support to regulations and public policy has been observed. it is therefore recommended to further involve public authorities in the standards setting and referencing processes. therefore, an enhanced engagement of member states will be a fundamental achievement; other practical measures will be envisaged, such as a common kit/toolbox/template with communication material for individual use in the member states. participants lead: national standardisation body of portugal sponsors: 2 eu ms, 4 nsb of eu ms, 1 eso, 2 industrial associations, european commission state of play the action-group has made good progress on defining a roadmap of actions. individual contacts took place between the sponsors and their national contact points in order to assess the interest to organise national information sessions or to produce information material. at present a practical manual for regulators on use and referencing of standards in legislation is under consultation (closing date: 10 october 2017). the final outcome will be a tool box containing the manual, a training programme and material (power point). a roll-out campaign is scheduled for 2018. action 5 - pilot project - aiding the implementation of the construction products regulation (cpr) through standards scope and objectives: the action focuses on mapping some of the main specificities and challenges pertaining to harmonised standards and the standardisation process for construction products. it will cultivate a common understanding on the role of harmonised standards in the cpr context; it will clarify the role of the various actors and explore the use of a simplified procedure for amending existing mandates. furthermore, the action will enhance the process of introducing new classes and threshold levels into harmonised standards and apply collaborative efforts to ensure their timely revision and citation. participants: commission (dg grow), member states, cen, nsbs, sbs, industry state of play: a working group (wg) was established comprising representatives of the above mentioned sponsors. the wg has met on a monthly basis. so far, the wg has finalised the action sheet. five sub-actions were identified to achieve the action's overall objective for which the work has begun: \u00a7 action 1: promotion of a common understanding and the role of standards in the cpr context including clear definitions of the roles of the different actors. \u00a7 action 2: explore and clarify the use o f a simplified procedure for amending existing mandates \u00a7 action 3: further improve the process of introducing new classes and threshold levels into harmonised european standards (hen) \u00a7 action 4: streamline process for timely revisions and citation of hens th rough collaborative efforts \u00a7 action 5: ensure continued availability of cpr consultants and their effective use in resolving outstanding issues. target date for the action is december 2019; one of the objectives is to resolve the outstanding publication of references in the ojeu and to mitigate past bottlenecks into new, more efficient procedures. in addition, a workshop has been organised in december 2016 between ec, european standardisation organisations, stakeholders, respective technical committees, national standardisation bodies, industry associations and industry to address the issue of non-published harmonised standards in the ojeu. an action plan has been established. action 6 \u2013 improve the exchange of information and dialogue with industry through a standards market relevance roundtable (\u201csmarrt\u201d) scope and objectives from the side of many actors of the system, the need for a better exchange of information, more transparency and dialogue to enhance the effectiveness of the legislator\u2019s use of the european standardisation system has been strongly called for. to achieve this result, and in line with article 12 of regulation (eu)1025/2012, an adequate consideration of market relevance, in addition to public policies and regulation is needed. in order to look at improvements for market relevant testing of european standardisation policy planning, a roundtable is established between the european commission and industry, called: \u201cstandards market relevance round table\u201d, \u201csmarrt\u201d. this roundtable will meet on a regular basis in full transparency, for example, during the development of draft standardisation requests, prior to committee on standards meetings, to offer market relevant opinions. participants the action is led by the commission; the sponsors of the action include also industry, two member states, three esos, one nsb and two annex iii organisations. state of play on 06 october 2016, a preparatory meeting to set up the \u201cstandards market relevance round table\u201d, (\u201csmarrt\u201d) was held. in this meeting, a consensus was reached with respect to the basic principles for the operation of the smarrt. the first meeting of the smarrt was organised on 17 february 2017, prior to the 1 st comitology committee on standards meeting of 2017 of 9 march 2017. the second meeting of the smarrt was organised on 13 june 2017, prior to the 2 nd comitology committee on standards meeting of 27 june 2017. action 7 - optimisation of operational aspects of regulation (eu) 1025/2012 scope and objectives it is important to use the planning instruments and tools at eu level to their full extent to effectively support policy objectives. stakeholder collaboration and coordination are fundamental for optimised support to eu policy priorities and for the effectiveness of these instruments. an analysis of the available planning instruments for standardisation at eu level and a gathering of best practices as evidence to support eu policy objectives would help to clarify the different roles, responsibilities, processes, objectives and deliverables, and would contribute to better plan further actions (e.g. complementary coordination actions). participants commission (dg grow, dg cnect), member states, esos, nsos, industry associations state of play the action group has met on a monthly basis through teleconferences. so far, it has found a common agreement and finalised the action sheet. in addition, background documents were elaborated providing information on the commission's annual union work programme (auwp) in standardisation, the ict rolling plan for ict standardisation, the european multi stakeholder platform (msp) on ict standardisation and the committee on standards (cos). target date for the action is december 2019. action 8 \u2013 provide high-quality standards delivered and referenced in a timely manner scope and objectives the strong call for standards/specifications issued when the market/regulations/public policies need them and when the users of the standards are ready to implement their requirements or use them in the legislation is an undeniable need expressed by the actors of the system - be it policy makers, industry or society \u2013 a challenge which has to be tackled through collaborative processes: improvement of performance in terms of quality and timeliness over the entire life cycle of european standards linked with policy and regulations, ensuring that the roles and competences of each actor remain preserved, in respect of the european and member state regulations. participants three european standardisation organisations, seven stakeholders' organisations, four national standards bodies, one member state and the european commission. state of play workplan and deadlines consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details, a number of teleconferences and face-to-face meetings took place to define them. the most recent meeting of the action group of 12 september 2017 in brussels discussed the 3 work items as previously agreed: \u00a7 work item 1 - standardisation requests development process \u00a7 wi 2 - standards development process \u00a7 wi 3 - assessment of (draft) harmonised standards and publication in the ojeu at the same time, the action group agreed to add one additional work item extending the scope of work item 3 with the aim to put the discussions on the development, assessment, verification and publication of harmonised standards in a broader context. this additional work item could address questions like: are there better ways to reach the purpose of the jis action 8 exercise? \u2022 what benefits can be taken from \u2018digitization\u2019? \u2022 are the current tools (like \u2018annex z\u2019) the best way to meet the ec requirements? \u2022 how can \u2018seamlessness\u2019 be ensured in data available from various sources (ojeu, websites, databases,\u2026)? action 9 \u2013 inclusiveness, transparency & effective participation of all stakeholders in the european standardisation system scope and objectives an increased awareness of the role of annex iii organisations would strengthen the system, as well as increase their contribution during the development of standards, and to overcome additional obstacles at international level. in order to promote a real and effective inclusiveness of the european standardisation system, an easy access of all interested stakeholders to national, european and international standardisation work and their effective participation should be supported through appropriate means and actions. awareness raising actions targeted at national standards bodies and technical bodies should take place. it is also of importance that standards are market relevant and reflect the interests and needs of all stakeholders, including societal and environmental. participants leader: dg grow sponsors: cen/cenelec, etsi, anec, ecos, etuc, sbs, etui, orgalime, bsi, nen, afnor state of play after the first meeting in december 2016, a second one took place in may 2017. the fruitful and positive exchange during this second meeting allowed for the smooth finalisation of the action fiche. a strong link with actions 10 and 15 was included in the final text, so that results of the 3 actions are maximised and optimised. currently the action plan is consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details, with sponsors actively contributing by sending proposals for concrete actions to be implemented. din has joined has sponsor of the action. action 10 \u2013 facilitating participation of all stakeholders at national level scope and objectives enhanced participation of some existing and emerging categories of stakeholders at national level, including those representing societal and public interests (e.g. national authorities including market surveillance) would bring added value to the final quality of the standardisation deliverables. as contributions from all stakeholders are considered to be pivotal in order to produce state-of-the-art standards, tools are to be developed through which participation of underrepresented categories could be extended at national level to more countries, building on existing best practices. participants leader: france (ministry of finances) sponsors: anec, ecos, etuc, sbs, bsi, nen, afnor, dg grow. uk, french ministry for ecology and sustainable development, french ministry for social affairs and health state of play at this stage, only france is represented at member state level; therefore in 2017 the french representative has asked for the involvement of other member states and has also asked for the commission's support in order to mobilise them. after this call for interest, greece has expressed the will to support the french colleagues in their work. the first stage of the action implementation consisted of an in-depth analysis of the current situation. for this purpose, a questionnaire has been prepared (and discussed at a meeting in paris, january 2017) which has been distributed in the first half of the year, also through the network of the committee on standards. to be exact, two questionnaires have been sent out: one targeted to national standard bodies and ms authorities, and one targeted to stakeholders. now that the answers to the questionnaires have been collected, there is the need to move forward and: - share the results; - analyse them; - identify areas for improvement; - decide how to run the next step. this will be done during a confcall meeting on september, 20th. action 11 \u2013 increased use of standards in public procurement to better implement the public procurement directives scope and objectives currently, there is a rather low use of standards in public procurement, which means that suppliers face numerous, different requests and various definitions in the \u201csuppliers documents\u201d, resulting in higher costs and inefficiency in procurement. approximately, \u00b12% of goods and services in public procurement cross the borders today in the eu. therefore, practical and concrete actions should be envisaged, such as a guide, for how to use standards in combination with the new procurement directive. in order to improve the current situation, it would also be important to find out how member states deal with the use of standards in public procurement in terms of structure, tools, guides, education etc. a study or analysis could be considered in that context. participants two of the three european standardisation organisations, five industrial stakeholders, eight national standards bodies, five member states and the european commission. state of play work-plan foresees 4 separate outcome where drafting process for output 2 (guide) is most advanced. \u00b7 output 1: analysis of pu blic sector procurement activities (might be merged with output 2); \u00b7 output 2: guide on how to reference standards in tender dossiers and contracts; \u00b7 output 3: process management standard or guide; \u00b7 output 4: dissemination of best practice. action 12 \u2013 encouraging the greater development and use of european service standards to help integrate europe's service markets scope and objectives both the 2006 services directive and regulation (eu) no 1025/2012 on european standardisation recognise the potential benefits of service standards to increase market transparency, raise quality and safety, and facilitate market access for businesses and consumers. indeed, there is untapped potential for service standards in europe, respecting national and european regulations. while their number is growing, most existing and newly emerging services standards are national (fewer than 20% of existing service standards are european). this action will look to promote where appropriate the increased development and use of market driven european service standards to benefit european businesses and consumers, through better identification and prioritisation of areas, where standards could help the integration of europe's services markets, increased awareness and understanding of services standardisation, and greater involvement of services providers and users in services standardisation. cen, with the contributions of all stakeholders, will develop and implement a strategy to address european standardisation in the field of services (by 2018). the implementation will include prioritisation of service areas (taking into consideration the ec guidance document as taken up in the staff working document of the 1 june 2016 standardisation package) and the development of an awareness raising package with the support and contribution of relevant stakeholders in 2017 and 2018. participants very diversified support for this action: one of the european standardisation organisations has the lead, supported by the commission, two member states, one stakeholder organisation, 4 national standards bodies and several business organisations. state of play workplan already well defined, with milestones and deadlines up to 2018. the cen strategy on services standardisation was published early 2017, is coherent with the june 2016 dedicated guidance issued by the european commission, take into account the inputs received during the stakeholders\u2019 engagement workshop of october 2016 and considers national competences in a number of service areas. action 13 \u2013 promote the european regulatory model supported by voluntary standards and its close link to international standardisation in third countries. scope and objectives considering it is widely recognised as a success story and a best practice, the european regulatory and standardisation model should be promoted outside the eu and efta member states. this means that all stakeholders should globally promote the concept of common regulatory objectives supported by voluntary standards developed in a transparent and inclusive way (cf. the \u201cnew approach\u201d and nlf-type legislation) outside europe, in the context of international trade negotiations and other relevant channels.. participants one of the european standardisation organisations has the lead on this action, supported by the other two, the commission, two stakeholder organisations, some national standards bodies and several business organisations. state of play workplan, milestones and deliverables are being defined and several teleconferences took place up until the summer. the action is now split in several well defined and concrete deliverables: 1. identification of 3 geographic priority areas relevant to all stakeholders (including the ec, via its fta negotiations and/or regulatory dialogues with a strong standardisation dimension), 2. develop a promotion strategy, agreeing core messages and communica tion channels/support, target groups, indicators to measure success, timeline and key milestones a well as develop support materials as needed (e.g. brochures, ppts\u2026) 3. raise awareness among relevant ec services 4. ensure appropriate involvement of european sta ndardization and industry stakeholders in relevant regulatory dialogues and trade negotiations 5. launch a pilot initiative to support the development of an african continental free trade area based on the european quality infrastructure model and on \"new app roach\" and nlf principles (to be confirmed if all stakeholders agree to the relevance of this region) 6. launch within h2020 a support action to reinforce the presence of eu in international ict standardisation. 7. projects within foreign policy instrument to promote eu ict standardisation and ict standards in other regions. action 14 \u2013 standardisation to support digitisation of european industry scope and objectives digitisation of european industry and services represent an important opportunity for the growth of the european businesses and for the society, as well as an important milestone in the context of achieving a digital single market. industry in europe has had longstanding leadership in factory automation and intelligent manufacturing technologies. currently, digitisation of industry and services and the application of cognitive technologies set connections across sectors as well as throughout the value chain, from the innovator to the manufacturer and from provider to the consumers. this is a push for innovation and technology integration throughout the value chain. the ec package on \u201cdigitising of european industry\u201d as well as several initiatives at member state level and within industry federations recognise that standardisation has an important role to play, helping european industry in securing their leadership in manufacturing and service provision adapting best available digital technologies, amongst other benefits: \"an effective standardisation environment for digital technologies is crucial for digitising european industry, and is key for the digital single market. ict standards allow devices and services to connect seamlessly across borders and technologies. in the future, billions of connected devices - including appliances, industrial equipment, and sensors \u2013 depend on such seamless communication, regardless of manufacturer, technical details, or country of origin.\" the smart collaboration between cen, cenelec and etsi, together with industry actors, ec/efta member states and other international and global organisations and initiatives, can pave the way for promoting an effective set of standards, taking into account existing ones available at european and global level, resulting in an efficient support to digitisation of industry. the overall scope of action 14 is the leverage and further improvement of the effective standardisation environment to provide standards and other standardisation deliverables enabling and promoting the digitisation of european industry. in addition, it encourages coordination between european and national standardisation programmes and related deployment activities. also, it foresees in the promotion of the global cooperation and acceleration of the transposition of standards and standardisation deliverables at international level. this action is looking at how to best support the eu policy objectives, as, for example, outlined in the ec package on \u201cdigitising of european industry\u201d. state of play the actions undertaken in the context of action 14 relate to the pillars of the ict standards priorities of the dsm, in particular big data and data protection, cyber security and internet of things the aim of action 14 is therefore to create an overarching initiative that engages with a multitude of stakeholders and european/national policy and standardisation initiatives that are addressing the various aspects of the digitalisation of european industry. the actual focus in the first months of action 14 has been on some vertical areas, namely advanced manufacturing of products, processes, and systems including robotics, and on smart meters and smart grids as well as smart cities and efficient energy use. these areas are intrinsically linked to priority standardisation domains (iot and big data) that are addressed in the communication on ict standardisation priorities for the dsm adopted in april 2016, as well as their wider impact on the digital transformation on industry. further work on action 14 shall be conceived in a way to ensure its alignment with the implementation of the ict standardisation priorities, and will an explanation on how, by whom and by when the actions will be implemented. in addition, the group will have a strategic reflection on these aspects and on possible forthcoming priorities related to these topics. participants action leaders: cen, cenelec and etsi sponsors: 1. ec: dg cnct, dg grow 2. nsos: afnor, bsi, din, nen 3. member states: france, germany 4. industry: bitkom, digitaleurope, fieec, orgalime, unife, zvei action 15 \u2013 pilot project \u2013 improve the representation of the interests of smes in europe in international standardisation processes scope and objectives standards drafted by international standards\u2019 bodies, such as iso and iec, are more and more important on the global markets. they are increasingly transposed as harmonised standards in europe to prove presumption of conformity with eu legislation. smes from europe should have their voices better heard in international standardisation, based on the improvements that have been made at european level. international standards that meet the needs of smes in europe contribute to enhancing their competitiveness. while the presence of smes and their associations is already improving at european level, more should be done to ensure appropriate representation and effective participation in international standardisation processes, building on existing best practice; this could also be extended to the other societal stakeholders under the annex iii of regulation (eu) no 1025/2012. there is, hence, room for more coordinated strategies and joint efforts by european stakeholders and national standardisation bodies to influence the processes at iso and iec - both at the technical and policy - level. also, best practices for smes at the international level could be promoted for the benefit of smes in europe, where appropriate with the help of national standardisation bodies. these best practices can also benefit to the other societal stakeholders, annex iii organisations. participants two of the three european standardisation organisations, three stakeholders' organisations (one of which is in the lead), two national standards bodies and the european commission. state of play it has been agreed that action 9, 10 and 15 will be addressed to all annex iii organisations representing societal stakeholders in standardisation (i.e. smes, consumers, environment and trade unions)in order to improve the inclusiveness of the standardisation process at all levels, national, european and international. the core of this action is to raise inclusiveness at international, iso-iec level. discussions are still ongoing, but a draft action plan has been proposed, from identifying good practices at national, european and international level to reinforcing coordination between smes, societal stakeholders and nsos (as nsos are those participating directly to io and iec work). the final aim is to establish cooperation between annex iii organisations and iso and iec, possibly in the form of a structured dialogue. 2. progress of implementation of the actions foreseen in the auwps, including on the development of european service standards (from planning up to transmission of a specific standardisation request to the esos) reference in the 2017 auwp swd(2016)185 accompanying the com(2016)357 objective state of play commission's priorities 1 the european e-competence framework (http://www.ecompetences.eu/) for it professionals is a european standard. now cen should work on the development of a comprehensive european framework for the ict profession. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 2 in order to implement new regulation (eu) no 165/2014 and revised directive 96/53/ec on digital tachographs and on weights and dimensions an additional standard on dsrc is needed to allow the transmission of data via dsrc from a fix weigh in motion (wim) station to a moving vehicle equipped with a smart tachograph the work has not started yet. this action will be however removed from the work programme for next year due to its low level of interest and the threads to tachograph security 2. a connected digital single market 3 the commission is evaluating the need for standardisation with the industry and other stakeholders in the framework of the forum on digital transport and logistics that was launched in summer 2015. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 4 enabling harmonisation of licensing process and industrial standards for eu nuclear infrastructures development throughout their lifetime (construction, operation, and decommissioning, waste management). consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 4. a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base and 1. a new boost for jobs, growth and investment 5 increase of renewable energies in the power mix contributes to energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. injection of renewable electrolytic hydrogen into the ng grid allows to exploit the huge storage capacity of the ng grid and to link the gas and power grids, enhancing energy security , and to decarbonise the transport, heat and industrial sectors. to enable this, new and/or updated european standards on interoperability between grids, on safe admixture of hydrogen to the ng grid, on gas quality and on compatibility with end-use appliances are needed. standardisation aspects of electrolysers for grid balancing standardisation aspects of hydrogen admixture to natural gas grid: safety, gas quality, \u2026 standardisation aspects related to

products regulation (eu) 305/2011 and drinking water directive 98/83/ec do not set out limits for the transfer of substances that are components of materials to drinking water they are in contact with (only exist for food in contact with materials). hygienic and safety requirements and test methods for construction products in contact with water intended for human consumption have been developed in a rudimentary way by tc164, but further specific standardisation work on hygiene and safety for products and materials in contact with drinking water is urgently needed. a replacement of mandate to cen m/136rev2 concerning the execution of standardisation work for harmonised standards on construction products in contact with water intended for human consumption is ongoing. the commission has withdrawn m/136 and is currently working on a number (3-4) mandates for products in contact with drinking water for which hens under mandate m/131 exist; stakeholder consultation in q1 2017; final mandates foreseen q3/q4 2017 4. a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base 8 the development of certain new product standards, e.g. for innovative products and the

industrial base reference in the 2016 auwp swd(2015)301 accompanying the com(2015)686 objective state of play commission's priorities 1. the current european standard en 301 549 was adopted under mandate m376 from the commission. parts of the standard refer to web accessibility. after the adoption of the directive on accessibility of public sector bodies' web sites (currently consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details by the european parliament and the council) a follow up is necessary to establish harmonized standards for the presumption of conformity for the accessibility requirements set out in the directive. that follow up should be coherent with the ongoing revision process. on 27/04/2017 was issued the commission implementing decision (c(2017)2585) \u2013m/554 on a standardisation request to the european standardisation organisations in support of directive (eu) 2016/2102 of the european parliament and of the council on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies 2. a connected digital single market 2. the present labelling and marking schemes rely on physical labels. with the uptake of ecommerce and online retailing, traditional labelling is becoming less effective to convey information to consumers. it is expected that elabelling will also facilitate demonstrating and verifying ecompliance with regulatory requirements, while keeping labelling costs at affordable levels, in particular to smes consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 3. directive on patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare established the ehealth network (ehn) of representatives of national authorities responsible for ehealth. its objective is to work towards delivering sustainable economic and social benefits of european ehealth systems and services, and in particular to promote their interoperability. the new joint action on ehealth, liaising with standardisation organisations and other relevant stakeholders, will support the ehealth network in taking policy decisions on standardisation initiative in the ehealth sector to boost interoperability, in line with the work plan 2015-1018 of the ehealth network. in particular, it will explore the option of starting a standardisation process of specific elements of the guidelines adopted by the ehealth network as well as of other cross-border ehealth services, such as interoperability aspects of telemedicine. in this rdronegards, the commission will support member states co-operation on interoperability by further developing and validating specifications and components and also through standardisation mandates if necessary. in addition a special effort should be dedicated to interoperability and harmonised coding of clinical databases, screening databases, genetic databases, cancer registries and, more in general, of all health-related databases (in the medium term to make it possible to interface health data with e.g. environmental, food safety, safety at work data the joint action supporting the ehealth network (jasehn) 2015-2018 delivered technical guidance to support the establishment of the european ehealth digital service infrastructure for purpose of cross-border exchange of prescription and patient summaries; as well as a policy paper, reports and recommendations to promote the use of common standards or technical specifications in ehealth within the eu. the new ehealth network multi annual work programme 2018-2021 adopted in november 2017 and the 3rd joint action on ehealth to be launched in june 2018 will equally promote the use of common standards for the wider exchange of health data in the eu and develop a strategy on european semantic interoperability. 2. a connected digital single market 4. creation of the international patient summary: the objective of this action is to participate in the standardisation of the international patient summary and ensure an european presence in the development of this standard. this work is performed under the auspices of the transatlantic economic council and is formalised in the eu-us ehealth/health it memorandum of understanding, its roadmap and annex. standardisation activity should take into consideration the patient summary guidelines endorsed by the ehealth network. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 5. creation of an european standard on quality criteria for the development of health and wellness apps. in order to enhance the quality of health and wellness apps, the commission has proposed in the 2016 rolling plan for ict standardisation a standard on quality criteria for the development of health and wellness apps (e.g. functionality, usability, reliability). the standard could be based on the publicly available specification pas:277 recently published by the british standards institution (bsi) and would provide guidance to app developers by setting out principles to follow throughout the app development life cycle, including testing, maintenance and risk management. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 6. standardization of location authentication based on the commercial service and the open service of galileo. development of performance standards and associated test procedures to standardise the location authentication. the activities will upgrade the interfaces between elements in the chain, in particular from the gnss signals to the final location services. the work may address standardization groups such as oma, 3gpp, cen/cenelec, etsi, imo. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 7. the common information sharing environment for the surveillance of the eu maritime domain (maritime cise) action seeks to enhance automatic information sharing between the national authorities involved in maritime surveillance, including defence. the development of standards enabling national systems to become interoperable is instrumental to promote and ease cross-sector and cross-border information sharing. the launch of the action, foreseen for the 2nd quarter of 2016, has been postponed of approximately 10 months due to the unexpected delay suffered by the ms-led preparatory project called 'eucise 2020' funded under fp7. the aim of eucise 2020 is to set-up and test a prototype solution for decentralised information exchange among national legacy systems used for maritime surveillance, and to deliver refined recommendations on standardisation needs for ict interoperability standards. prior to drafting a mandate, the commission is investigating how the e-navigation concept and the evolution of global maritime distress and safety system (gmdss) affect marine radio communication and navigation standardisation in the mid/long term, taking also into account future requirements in terms of capacity/rate for data transmission as well as security aspects which are essential for improving maritime safety. 2. a connected digital single market 8. standardization activities for the galileo timing service and the galileo search and rescue return link service. these standardization activities will address the standardisation of user receiver components including receiver chip, calibration of location timing receivers and processing of gnss signals to obtain precise timing products. the actions will develop performance standards to standardise timing services provision and will investigate the use of the rls for remote beacon activation of elt in aircraft consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 2. a connected digital single market 9. objective is to facilitate the flow, access and use of information in transport, in order to enhance efficiency and reduce costs of transport operations consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details, considering the commission decision c(2015)2259 setting up an expert group on digital transport and logistics; communication 2. a connected digital single market 10. the commission is considering issuing a standardisation request with respect to access to in-vehicle data. this will be developed within the framework of the cooperative its initiative (platform, working group, master plan) a study (final report in june 2017) is currently on-going to identify possible options/scenarios regarding access to in-vehicle data. depending on the results on this study, standardisation may be launched related to the physical/electrical/logical interface including minimum level of security (see ict rolling plan 2016 p. 86 action 14). as it touches the vehicle, most probably dg grow would be in the lead. launch of process in the commission: 3rd quarter of 2017. deadline for delivery by the standardisers: preliminary results by end of 2018 - final standards by end 2020 2. a connected digital single market 11. further standardisation requests in support of commission regulations implementing the ecodesign directive (e.g. televisions, smart appliances, machine tools and welding equipment) will be issued as individual mandates. a new mandate on welding equipment should be adopted in q1 2017. a standardisation mandate on the ecodesign and energy labelling of ventilation units has been adopted on 27/11/2015 (m/537). 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 12. where the commission considers it likely that new measures (i.e. commission regulations or commission delegated regulations) on ecodesign and/or energy labelling will be proposed for products under the ecodesign working plan 2012-14, new standardisation requests in these fields could be issued. activities are proceeding in this workstream, with individual mandate on computer servers being issued to esos in 2017. 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 13. standardisation requests in support of new commission regulations implementing the ecodesign/energy labelling directive on the taps and showers products will be issued as individual mandates. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 14. the commission is currently initiating a research and innovation policy agenda to further develop and upscale the use of nature-based solutions and to promote the market for them in europe and worldwide\u2013 including green infrastructure elements and adaptation measures. this refers as well to the sustainable construction of buildings (such as with green roofs and walls). the development of protocols for functional or performance based specifications and measurement and testing methodologies, leading eventually to standardisation, would help the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of nature-based solutions in economic, social and environmental terms, support public procurement of such solutions and overall stimulate the market for them. in addition to the above mentioned activities under horizon 2020, a dedicated feasibility study is needed to involve relevant stakeholders to scan the area on this particular subject, based on and complementing actions towards standardisation prepared by other services. the communication com(2013)249 on the strategy on green infrastructure identifies standards as possibly contributing to 'growing the market' for green infrastructure solutions. the commission will assess how technical standards, particularly in relation to physical building blocks and procedures, could increase the deployment of green infrastructure. internal work to prepare a mandate is being started, aiming at a completed draft mandate by the end of q2 2018. 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 15. an external consultant has been carrying out for dg clima a survey in member states to find out where the obstacles and gaps are as regards standards to enabling a broader uptake of alternative, climate-friendly technologies. results were discussed with stakeholders (consultation forum) and are available in 4th quarter 2015. these results will be the basis for drafting a mandate to european standardization organisations. m/555 -commission implementing decision c(2017)7284 on a standardisation request to the european committee for standardisation and to the european committee for electrotechnical standardisation as regards use of flammable refrigerants in refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 16. the minamata convention regulates i.e. emissions of mercury from industrial processes at a global level. under the industrial emissions directive there is an obligation to monitor mercury emissions from relevant sources, in particular coal fired power plants and waste incineration plants. some member states are applying more frequent emission monitoring at the most relevant sources. there is a need for a reliable and practical standardised method allowing both short term and long term mercury emission monitoring. such a method could be based on the existing us epa standard. activity taking place in the context of the global earth observation (geo) initiative, task: \"he-02-c1: global mercury observation system\" https://www.earthobservations.org/ts.php?id=171 and the fp7 funded project \"global mercury observation system \u2013 gmos\" http://www.gmos.eu/ that should be taken into account when the new standards will take place. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 17. a new bref on production of wood-based panels is under preparation and the bat conclusions are scheduled to be adopted by the commission in 2015. the need to develop a european standard for the monitoring of formaldehyde was highlighted in this document. the standard could also be applied in other industrial sectors where this pollutant is emitted. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 18. standardisation will be needed to implement the clean power for transport package, including the european alternative fuels strategy and the directive 2014/94/eu of 22 october 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. in addition to already ongoing work of cen. cenelec and etsi under the existing mandates in support of the implementation of this directive, standardisation work on labelling is also needed for meeting the requirement of the directive to provide the users with simple and easy to understand information on the compatibility of their vehicles with the fuels or electricity re-charging points. consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 3. a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy 19. completion of the

field of aerodynamic effect on ballast for high speeds, eddy current brake, track geometry quality levels, load limits and variable gauge wheel sets consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details 4. a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base 24. directive 2009/48/ec is the legal basis to ensure the free movement of toys that provide a high level of safety for children under 14 years of age. the directive requires toys to be safe with regard to physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties, electrical properties, hygiene and radioactivity. ensuring a high level of safety throughout the eu and by all stakeholders as well as the free movement of toys in the internal market requires standardised specifications. these specifications need to keep up with new scientific-technical and market developments, such as the development of innovative toys, and reports about accidents with toys. the available specifications therefore require updates as appropriate, the establishment of new specifications is of a lower priority. new actions by the standardisers are being programmed for example on activity toys (in-house toy trampolines) and on tests for chemicals in toys in accordance with recent amendments of directive 2009/48/ec. 4. a deeper and fairer internal

food contact materials. these include regulation 10/2011 (oj l 12, 15.1.2011, p. 1) on plastic materials, directive 84/500/eec on ceramic articles and regulation (ec) no 450/2009 on active and intelligent materials. these acts set out limits for the transfer of substances that are components of materials to the food they are in contact with. the transfer of more than 1000 relevant substances may need to be determined in analytical testing. yet only a very limited number of standardized methods are available. certain emerging issues (oligomer migration, multi-analytical methods) call for the establishment of different standards to prevent that they develop into a non-tariff barriers. moreover testing for specific substances may be selected according to internal market/trade relevance. to this end com services (jrc) are already collaborating with iso tc166 (ceramic ware, glass-ceramic ware and glass dinnerware in contact with food -- release of lead and cadmium). internal work to prepare a mandate is being started, aiming at a completed draft mandate by the end of q2 2018. the work has been narrowed down to standardised methods and analytical data for the determination of certain specific substances. the focus will give priority to multi-analytical methods, followed by methods for single substances. methods for oligomer migration are being considered as well, but these may need further development before being ready for standardisation. 4. a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base 29. directive 2008/50/ec states that modelling

quality in the area of air quality, pre-normative research has led to the development of methodologies to measure organic and inorganic gaseous air pollutants, particulate matter and constituents of particulate matter, such as metals, carbonaceous content and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are included in the air quality directives 2004/107/ec, 2008/50/ec and cd 2015/1480. moreover, pre-normative research for the validation and development of new protocols and methods for air quality modelling, source apportionment and the use of sensing technologies has led to the provision of data quality objectives and technical specifications currently consultation between the commission and the stakeholders on the technical and operational details and to be considered in future applications and procedures. photovoltaics in the area of photovoltaic solar electricity the jrc has used its pre-normative research to develop international standards to support new energy materials in the field of innovative multi-junction solar devices. photovoltaic energy generation has become a significant source of low carbon energy around the world and is continuing to expand. the drive to reduce costs and improve efficiencies has led to the development of new photoactive materials structures, which include multi-junction devices. the jrc has used its pre-normative research into the characterisation of these multi-junction devices to lead the project team within iec in the writing of two standards which will enable these devices to be characterised. both standards have reached the final voting stage (final draft international standard, fdis) and been adopted and published in may. these new standards (iec 60904-1-1 and iec 60904-8-1) support innovation by increasing the confidence of investors and developers in these new technologies. pre-normative jrc research on material efficiency and preparation/response of ec mandates 3 pre-normative research has been led by jrc to demonstrate the relevance and feasibi lity of potential requirements on material efficiency of products in the context of the ecodesign directive (2009/125/ec). this work was based on the application of an original jrc method to specific product groups. however, requirements on material effici ency (e.g. on recyclability, durability, reparability) had so far a limited adoption in implementing regulations, mainly due to the lack of appropriate standards. hence, jrc supported other commission services for the preparation of the standardisation man date m/543 to european standardization organizations (esos) on \u201cecodesign requirements on material efficiency aspects for energy-related products\u201d. this mandate was included in the action plan of the circular economy package (issued in december 2015), and it was accepted by esos in january 2016. standardization deliverables are now under development by cen/cenelec, taking into account in particular the results of pre-normative research by jrc. preparatory work of the standardisation mandate has been analyse d by jrc in a recent scientific paper 4 . cooperative intelligent transport systems (c-its) the pre-normative research has contributed to the definition of the security elements of cooperative intelligent transport systems (c-its), embracing a wide variety of communications-related applications intended to increase travel safety, minimise environmental impact, improve traffic management and maximise the benefits of transportation to both commercial users and the general public. the work will contribute to the drafting of a future ec mandate and legislation for the deployment of c-its in europe. in the area of cybersecurity and digital privacy pre-normative research is contributing to the implementation of standards and specific legislation for the definition of an eu wide security certification scheme and seamless trustworthy authentication across objects, devices and natural and legal persons based on comparable trust models. animal testing pre-normative research in the area of non-animal methods for skin sensation has led to the development of validated methods for the global implementation of standards at industry level for screening purposes and for complying with regional regulations on the safety assessment of chemicals. the work led to changes of the requirements for skin sensitisation within the reach regulation, prompted revision of the echa guidance to industry and resulted into the publication of two oecd guidance documents on the harmonised reporting of approaches for chemical safety assessment based on the integration of non-animal data. likewise, pre-normative research in the area of animal feed and feeding stuffs for the development of a method to determine two banned growth promotors in feed, carbadox and olaquindox, has resulted in the development of an en standard to be applied by member states' official control laboratories to check for compliance of feed samples with legal provisions. transport in the area of vehicle emissions, pre-normative research has led to the development of a methodology to measure the number of particles emitted by diesel engines, which was included in the euro5/6 legislation (reg. 715/2007 and 692/2008), making de-facto mandatory the use of wall flow particulate filters that have reduced particulate matter emissions from diesel engines in more than 30 million vehicles. moreover, pre-normative research for the validation and development of a new real driving emissions (rde) test procedure based on the use of particle emission measurement systems (pems) has led to the provision of data and definition of the technical specifications of the equipment to be used for regulatory purposes in the definition by the european commission of the third rde package expected to be approved by the end of 2016. measurements and metrology standardisation linked to measurements and metrology is essential to drive innovation. this is particularly true for new technologies and applications. the commission is funding research to directly support standardisation, i.e. pre-/co-normative research, under art. 185 tfeu initiative on metrology empir. in addition, a working group between empir and cen/cenelec called the stair-empir working group was formed to facilitate the link between the research projects and the standardisation bodies. security in the area of security , the european agenda on security is supported by european standardisation activities as well as ongoing pre-normative research under horizon 2020. innovative technology tools are needed to protect us from terrorist threats and include requirements for detection equipment as well as data quality and the interoperability of data systems recording crime statistics. several mandates are addressing standardisation aspects for security (m/487, m/512, m/530). for instance, mandate 487 concerns the analysis of the current security standards landscape in europe taking account of the legislative background and the drawing of a security standardisation map. ongoing security research in several domains is also contributing to harmonised certification schemes of security products and systems. list of research projects directly linked with standardisation projects start date end date

respectively smes, consumers, workers and environmental interests in standardisation) to the production processes of standards ( inclusiveness) the regulation 1025/2012 5 acknowledges the important role smes and societal stakeholders play in standardisation. european standards are seen as to be of vital interest for the competitiveness of smes and standards can also have broad impact on society. therefore, the regulation e nsures that the role and the input of smes and societal stakeholders in the development of standards are strengthened. since the entry into force of regulation 1025/2012, great effort has been made to allow smes and societal stakeholders to effectively take part in the standardisation activities. the commission have engaged in partnership agreements and financial agreements with four organisations respectively representing consumer, environmental and social interests as well as the interest of smes in standardisation at european level. the interests these organisations represent are recognised in the regulation 1025/2012 and in the annex iii of the regulation and the four organisations are the following: \u00b7 european association for the coordination of consumer representation in standardisation (anec) \u00b7 small business standards (sbs) \u00b7 european environmental citizens organisation for standardisation (ecos) \u00b7 conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration

domain went beyond the earmarked budget . 7. state of play of ict standardisation priorities for the digital single market eighteen months after the publication of the commission priorities, the actions proposed for the priority domains 5g communication networks, internet of things (iot), cloud computing, cyber security and (big) data technologies as well as those outlined in specific sectors like, ehealth, intelligent transport systems and connected & automated vehicles, smart energy and advanced manufacturing are progressing at a different pace. depending on the domain, the actions proposed can vary from further standard setting to coordination or leveraging of current work within the respective policies. focus may lay more on aspects like reference architectures, reference platforms and use cases to support digital transformation or other standardisation deliverables to support vertical innovation in the domain. cloud \u2013 horizon 2020 eu funded projects are contributing to the development of standards allowing service level agreements and interoperability/portability across the cloud. the commission has organised two workshops and is working with standardisation and open source communities towards the alignment of open source and standards within the cloud context, which can speed-up development processes and up-take of ict technical specifications, and reduce public procurement costs. iot \u2013 the new alliance of internet o f things innovation ( aioti) association 6 was set up in november 2017 replacing the aioti initiative . the association can now act as a formal representative for stakeholders and extend the cooperation with other iot global players - as one strong united eur opean voice for iot . aioti fosters consensus building on reference architectures, supports standardisation to fill any identified gaps, and is assessing possible iot identifiers. the global partnership project to develop iot technical specifications (onem2 m), has reached an important milestone by adopting a common service platform standard. in addition to this, the commission, in cooperation within the european cyber security organization (ecso) 7 and aioti, had organised in 2016 a series of workshops to cre ate an environment where consumers are aware of the degree of security and privacy of iot devices in the context of possible certification and trusted labelling for iot. 5g - the availability of the initial global 5g standards by the end of 2019 is among the actions of the 5g action plan[3]. furthermore, member states, in the ministerial declaration of tallinn (ref below) identify the objective of preserving 5g global interoperability as key in order to make 5g a success for europe. standards are of paramount importance to ensure the competitiveness and interoperability of global telecommunication networks. therefore member states endorse a \"comprehensive and inclusive approach to 5g standardisation as a priority for the digital single market\". member states promote \"cross-industry partnerships to support the timely definition of standards backed by industrial user experiments, including through the leveraging of international cooperation partnerships, in particular for the digitisation of industry. encouraging innovation and development of products and services making use of 5g networks across the eu should be a priority\". the commission supported the set-up of the 5g public-private partnership (ppp)[4], which ensures integration of requirements from all sectors. the 3rd global partnership project responsible for 5g standards (3g pp)[5] is working towards 5g standards. the commission has increased its participation to 3g pp in order to support politically the contributions by the 5g-ppp, and is taking steps to support the organisation of 3g pp meetings in europe, enabling the active participation of a broad range european delegates, from key industrial players, but also smes, academia and research institutions. the eu is working, through the european conference of postal and telecommunication administrations (cept), to agree on a strong eu position on spectrum in the international telecommunication union (itu).. to meet objectives on global interoperability on 5g (spectrum, standards and research) the commission signed a joint declaration with its counterparts in brazil, china, japan and south korea and cooperates closely with the usa and india. ref: ministerial declaration \"making 5g a success for europe\" signed during the informal meeting of competitiveness a nd telecommunications ministers on 18 july in tallinn, see: https://www.eu2017.ee/sites/default/files/inlinefiles/ministerial%20declaration%205 g_final_0.pdf cybersecurity - the commission is working closely with member states and the european union agency for network and information security (enisa) in the network and information security (nis) directive cooperation group to identify best practice and sector-specific guidance for cybersecurity risk management based on european and international standards. furthermore, in september 2017 the commission put forward a proposal for a regulation on \"enisa, the \"eu cybersecurity agency\", and repealing regulation (eu) 526/2013, and on information and communication technology cybersecurity certification (''cybersecurity act'')\". a dedicated working group on standards and certification has been set up in the cybersecurity contractual public-private partnership (ecso). data - interoperability and standards is part of building a european data economy, which aims at fostering the best possible use of the potential of digital data to benefit the economy and society 8 . the commission established the big data value association (bdva) ppp and funds research and innovation projects through horizon 2020 9 to develop a roadmap towards a big data reference architecture and the production of ict standards for better interoperability of data to support cross-sectorial integ ration. the proposal for a regulation on privacy and electronic communications 10 calls for standardised icons in order to give an easily visible and intelligible overview of the collection of information emitted by terminal equipment, its purpose, the perso n responsible for it and of any measure the end-user of the terminal equipment can take to minimise the collection. new standardisation domains are being assessed, e.g. financial (fintech) and blockchain/distributed ledger technologies. regarding intelligent transport systems, pre-normative research has contributed to the definition of the cooperative intelligent transport systems (c-its) and communication protocols, including the security elements of, embracing a wide variety of communications-related applications intended to increase travel safety, minimise environmental impact, improve traffic management and maximise the benefits of transportation to both commercial users and the general public. the work will contribute to the drafting of a future ec mandate and legislation for the deployment of c-its in europe. as regards the second pillar , the commission regularly met stakeholders, and in particular the esos, to discuss the implementation of the various actions proposed. member state s, european and international standardisation organisations, fora and consortia, organisations representing industry and small and medium-size enterprises and societal representatives are all members of the multi-stakeholders platform on ict standardisatio n 11 , who follows up the implementation of the actions of the communication at each meeting. moreover, the commission has kept a regular dialogue with the other european institutions who have issued conclusions, opinions and reports on the communication 12 . in addition to this, the commission is working with esos and other sdos, fora and consortia and relevant stakeholders on possible measures to improve the ict standardisation ecosystem including promotion of interaction between open source and standardisation communities and the definition of a clear, balanced, sustainable and efficient standard essential patents (sep) framework. the commission published a communication on the latter in november 2017 13 . regarding the international outreach of european standardiz ation horizon 2020 cooperation and support actions will contribute to a reinforced presence on the international ict standardization scene through setting up an observatory and a funding facility to support participation of european experts on internationa l ict standardisation. the commission is also using the foreign policy instrument actions to foster international outreach of european ict standardization. finally, the commission is widely using horizon 2020 to fund research and innovation projects contri buting to standardisation and is working with the esos on actions to bridge the gap between research, innovation and standardisation. furthermore horizon 2020 public-private partnerships are essential for developing key digital technology building blocks. large scale pilot projects prepare broad deployment through test beds, experimentation facilities and pilot lines, leading to standardisation 14 . based on preliminary inputs from member states and industry, industrial platform initiatives have been identifie d for \u2018connected smart factory\u2019, \u2018health and care\u2019, \u2018smart agriculture\u2019, 'connected and automated mobility', \"smart energy', as well as for cross-cutting industrial data and internet of things platforms. 8. action plan to decrease the stock of non-cited harmo nised standards action plan structural solutions to decrease the stock of non-cited harmonised standards over the past three decades european standardisation has successfully contributed to the implementation of eu policies and legislation in a wide range of areas. in particular, european standardisation has been extremely successful and one of the driving factors of the creation of the internal market for goods, in particular due to the new approach legislative technique 15 . the union harmonisation legislation under the new approach promotes harmonised standards as a tool offering a guaranteed level of protection. products manufactured in compliance with harmonised standards benefit from a presumption of conformity with the corresponding essential requirements of the applicable union harmonisation legislation. in recent years, certain issues appeared with the publication of references to harmonised standards in the ojeu which resulted in an increased number of non-cited references. the current stock of non-cited references to harmonised standards is relatively high and joint efforts of all participants are needed to address the situation effectively. in order to address the current stock of non-cited harmonised standards and to make the process more transparent and accountable leading to a seamless citation, the following two short-term and two mid-term joint actions are considered of particular importance by both the commission and the european standardisation organisations (esos): short-term (q3/2017) 1. proceeding with currently non-cited harmonised standards in order to enable the citation of as many as possible currently non-cited harmonised standards, the esos and the commission will together draw up a prioritised list of harmonised standards in the most relevant sectors ( tentatively agreed sectors are: medical devices, construction, emc, red, lvd, railways ): \u2022 with those harmonised standards which comply with the requirements in the corresponding union legislation and display only minor (mainly formal) shortcomings, in exchange for the esos' commitment 16 to deliver revised versions within a defined p eriod. \u2022 with harmonised standards which can be addressed in the framework of short term pilot projects, with the participation of technical experts and management on both sides, leading to their possible conditional approval in view of their speedy referencing. a plan with pilot projects should be agreed between the ec and the esos. the esos will clearly identify the re-submissions of previously rejected standards including the modifications made. the re-valuation will be made within a timeframe to be agreed and in case of acceptance the standard will be cited in the ojeu without delay. 2. improving the support from the new approach consultants the main role of the new approach consultants (nac) is to check the compliance of the harmonised standards with the standardisation request and the requirements of the corresponding union legislation, during the development process. in principle, the activity of the new approach consultants is covered by a specific agreement that the commission has concluded with cen and cenelec until the end of 2017. in this system, the potential of new approach consultants is not fully utilised. there is a room for improvement in several areas, in particular when it comes to communication of the new approach consultants with the commission and technical bodies of the esos. experience shows that it is important that technical committees of the esos have a correct understanding of the content of the standardisation request and its legal objectives from the earliest stage of drafting harmonised standards. an early and effective communication between technical committees and the nac is a central element supporting the process of joint assessment (article 10(5) of the standardisation regulation 1025/2012) of the compliance of the documents drafted by the european standardisation organisations with the standardisation request. the commission will thus propose a new framework for the activity of the new approach consultants, with the aim to relieve the european standardisation organisations of the administrative burden related to their management, as well as to improve the overall involvement of the new approach consultants in the process of the drafting of harmonised standards. cen, cenelec and etsi are prepared to engage with the revamped system of nac representing the commission in the process of harmonised standards development. the nac are intended to facilitate transparency of the process by providing guidance and clarification within the confines of the standardisation request adopted in consultation with the esos and the member states. taking into account that the current specific agreement to cover the support from new approach consultants will conclude in december 2017, and that the role of the nac has been identified as an essential element in the joint assessment process, it is important to ensure the continuity of their services. the european commission will conclude the contractual arrangements for the continuation of the nacs ideally before end of 2017. in the case that this new framework cannot be finalised timely and the activity of the consultants could be disrupted as a result, the current specific agreement managed by cen and cenelec might be extended. medium-term (2018) 3. developing a common understanding of the process for joint assessment and citation of harmonised standards the standardisation regulation, regulation (eu) no 1025/2012, provides for a cooperative model for a joint assessment of draft harmonised standards by the commission and the esos, prior to the publication of references to harmonised standards in the ojeu . however, neither the way how this cooperative model should function in detail, nor the process of the publication in the ojeu, have yet been formalised. the new improved system of nacs (see point 2) will be the basis to implement the cooperative model for joint assessment of harmonised standards. in addition, the commission and the esos have agreed on a mechanism for the verification and publication process for harmonized european standards (hen) with a clear division of roles and responsibilities and strict deadlines. the main elements of the agreed process are outlined in some detail in the annex. 4. modernisation of the harmonised standards database the harmonised standards database (has database), hosted by the ec, aims at facilitating the delivery of eso\u2019s data required to allow the publication of the titles of harmonised standards in the ojeu in all official languages of the eu. the has database is used to generate the lists of harmo nised standards to be published in the ojeu in the format of commission communications. it is also used to generate/update content about harmonised standards on the ec european standards website . the commission and the european standardisation organisations consider it necessary to agree upon steps improving the functionality of the has database to better serve its purpose, in particular to facilitate the verification of references and related data (e.g. date of withdrawal) of harmonised standards and to provide an accurate overview of the outcome of the verification, as well as the follow-up steps. with respect to the above, the following action plan is jointly proposed by the commission and the esos: task who timetable to agree on a list of harmonised standards to be cited or re-valuated ec, eso q3 2017 to agree on plan for pilot meetings on the harmonised standards to be re-valuated ec, eso q3/2017 organise pilot meetings on specific agreed standards ec, eso q4/2017 q1-q2/2018 to streamline the process for joint assessment and publication of harmonised standards ec, esos end of 2017/early 2018 to set up a new framework for the activity of the new approach consultants ec 2017 to improve the functionality of the has database and the interface with the esos ec with the input of the eso 2017/2018 annex: the verification and publication processes for hens 1. eso: a. submits at pre-agreed dates following the conclusion of the joint assessment (article 10(5)) a formal note to the ec annexing lists of references to new, amended or resubmitted hens per sector, with full reference of data available in has database. b. provides i) the text of the harmonised standards (including, where relevant, the adopted international standard, including access to texts of its relevant normative references) through electronic format ii) the date of the formal note for each reference to new, amended or resubmitted hens as a part of the has upload together with any additional information possibly needed for the oj publication and as agreed with the ec services. 2. ec (grow b 3): a. acknowledges the receipt of the note (and registers in ares) within 15 working days b. sets 4-6 weeks deadline for operational units to verify each new hen (through ares) 3. ec (sector unit): a. verifies each new hen on the basis of consultants assessment reports and/or other available evidence criteria (such as the essential requirements, mand ate, work programme) b. records the results (positive/negative) in has database within the given timeframe (up to 6 weeks) c. informs (ares) grow b3 on the results of the verification. for hens rejected for citation provides in-depth explanation of the reasons, clearly identifying the relevant parts of the standard after its entire assessment d. where additional time is needed to complete the verification, informs the eso accordingly within the given timeframe 4. ec (grow b 3): a. submits a formal note to eso (ares) info rming on the results of the assessment. for rejected hens, provides in-depth reasons and asks for information within 15 working days on remedial actions within a timeframe to be mutually agreed b. finalises the \"publication decision\" to be signed by the cor responding director general, and the lists (per sector) of new hens accepted for citation in the oj. 5. ec (director general of dg grow or the corresponding dg) a. signs the decision 6. ec (grow b3): a. produces consolidated lists (communications) from has database and sends to secgen together with the publication decision for submission to the publication office 7. eso a. revises the standard on the basis of a negative assessment (point 4.a) provided by the commission and re-submits within a timeframe to be mutually agre ed. the timeframe will normally be agreed within 15 working days after the notification. b. in case of a resubmission of a rejected standard, indicates clearly changes made to the standard on the basis of reasons provided by the commission (point 4.a) 8. ec a. establishes a publication decision when the revised standard satisfies the outcome of the original assessment.
