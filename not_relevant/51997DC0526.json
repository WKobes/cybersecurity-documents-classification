the case of the csfs/spds in particular, the available appropriations were fully used only for objectives 1 and 6. the underutilisation of appropriations for objective 5(a) (91%) is mainly due to a lack of applications for advances for assistance under regulation (eec) no 2328/91. the level of utilisation of objective 5(b) budget (79%) was lower because of delays in applying for payment. fifg

programming period improved in 1996 compared to the two previous years: 90% implementation in 1994, 91% in 1995 and 98% in 1996. if these three years are compared with the 1989-93 programming period, the results for 1996 are comparable with the results at the half way stage in that preceding period. the improvement in the implementation rate of payment appropriations is even greater: 88% of the appropriations were implemented in 1996 (leaving ecu 1 233 million unused), as against 75% in 1994 (ecu 4 800 million unused) and 82% in 1995 (ecu 3 759 million unused). it should be remembered that the community payments depend on implementation of the programmes at national level since once the programme is adopted, the corresponding annual instalment is committed and a first advance is paid, the commission can make a second payment only when the member state can certify that the final beneficiaries have actually undertaken expenditure amounting to at least half of the first advance. this explains the accelerated rate of payments for many programmes adopted in 1995. 102 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 22. implementation of each fund in 1994-96 in the context of 1994-99

programming for the csfs and spds, overall implementation of erdf appropriations amounts to 99%, equal to a shortfall of ecu 360 million on the amount programmed for the 1994-96 period of ecu 32 390 million. however, progress varies depending on objective and member state. thus, for erdf objective 1, commitments are running ahead of the financing plans by ecu 670 million (2.6%) (in 1995 there was a shortfall of 1.3%), to the greatest degree in spain, ireland and portugal where extra implementation amounts to ecu 2 014 million. by contrast, the significant under-implementation in austria (49%), belgium (37%), germany (ecu 335 million), france (ecu 167 million), italy (ecu 700 million) and the netherlands amounted to ecu 1 314 million. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 103 by contrast, objective 2 showed erdf commitments lagging behind the financing plans by ecu 508 million (9%). the lag at the end of 1995 (18% - ecu 650 million) was shortened in part because of the need to commit all of the assistance adopted for the first programming phase 1994-96. the greatest lags in implementation affected spain (ecu 91 million), france (ecu 127 million), italy (ecu 117 million), the united kingdom (ecu 101 million) and the netherlands (-31%). only austria and sweden are running ahead of schedule,-because a single commitment for the entire 1995-99 period was made for the operations in which they are involved. erdf commitments for objective 5(b) are also lagging behind the financing plans by ecu 496 million (37%). implementation of this objective is running into severe difficulties in almost all member states. the greatest lags in absolute terms are in germany (ecu 47 million), france (ecu 157 million), italy (ecu 126 million, 74%) and the united kingdom (ecu 115 million), and in relative terms for belgium (74%), denmark (40%), luxembourg (71%) and the netherlands (56%). lastly, objective 6 is lagging behind the financing plans by ecu 24 million (25%). the lag is due entirely to sweden, where the operations were late starting for administrative reasons. implementation of the community initiatives with a regional bias (interreg, peace, rechar, r\u00e9sider, konver, retex, regis, urban and smes) are lagging behind for all funds by ecu 543 million for the period 1994-96 (13%). the lag was shortened (it stood at 32% in 1995) mainly as a result of the adoption of new programmes and for the three new member states in particular. budget implementation of commitments was also speeded up by virtue of the fact that a.large number of programmes involving a community contribution below ecu 40 million could be fully committed upon adoption (single commitment). 104 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) esf table 11-16: esf implementation in

the appropriations in 1996 ensured a commitment rate for all objectives above 90% of the instalments initially planned for the 1994-96 period when adopting the programmes. however, a scrutiny of the various objectives shows that objectives 1, 2 and 3 were implemented relatively well but that objectives 4, 5(b) and 6 are lagging well behind. divergent trends are also visible within each objective. in the case of objective 1, greece and italy in particular are experiencing delays. the delays under objective 2 concern in particular denmark, italy and the netherlands. while implementation of objective 3 is quite good overall, implementation in italy is relatively slow and the country has also reworked almost all of its programmes. most of the objective 4 and 5(b) programmes were adopted at the end of 1994 or beginning of 1995, which meant that there would be delays in their implementation. the results for objective 6 have been affected by start-up difficulties in sweden. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 105 the decisions approving the employment and adapt community initiatives were taken at the end of december 1994 (employment) and may 1995 (adapt) and the member states sought partners in other countries in the following months. as a result, the first contracts with the project promoters could not be signed until mid-1995, which explains why the appropriations were not used in 1994 and why take-up was just average in 1995. by contrast, the implementation rate for 1996 has been particularly satisfactory and all the projects have received at least their first advance. eaggf table 11-17: eaggf implementation in 1994-96 for the period 1994-99 (including decommitments, carry-overs and appropriations made available again - ecu million) objective 1 obj. 5(a)

the rates were 70% for objective 1, 54% for objective 5(a) and 50% for objective 6. of the total amount of assistance for the whole programming period, 45% had been committed by the end of 1996. the implementation of the programmes on the ground needs to be closely monitored as a result. in many cases, actual implementation (expenditure achieved as a proportion of total planned expenditure) fell well short of budget implementation, especially for those programmes that were also late on the budget side. if these programmes cannot soon make up for the lag, it will be difficult to commit and pay out all the assistance granted. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 107 b. checks and financial management regular and effective implementation of the structural funds appropriations determines the actual impact on the ground. under article 205 of the treaty, the commission is responsible for implementing the community budget and as such it ensures the quality of the management and monitoring systems which it and the member states use. this requirement, shared by the member states and reiterated by the commission on several occasions, is particularly topical in the context of the sem (sound and efficient management) 2000 initiative launched in 1995 which became operational in 1996. this management exercise, which related in particular to the structural policies, has allowed all the conditions and measures needed for the efficient management of the community funds to be examined in partnership with the member states. 1. checks to continue the activities carried out in previous years and as part of the sem 2000 initiative, the commission checked that the member states had adequate systems for the financial management and monitoring of the programmes. under article 23(1) of regulation (eec) no 4253/88, as amended, the member states are responsible for using the structural funds appropriations properly and for preventing irregularities. the commission therefore checks the reliability of the control and management systems and the regularity of expenditure. 1.1. checks carried out by the commission's structural funds departments erdf: 26 on-the-spot checks were carried out in 1996 (five in spain, four in germany and in portugal, three in ireland, two in austria, belgium, finland and france and one each in the netherlands and sweden). the checks, the programme for which is notified to the member states, are first and foremost intended to verify the existence and effectiveness of the systems for the management and control of operations, and the reliability of the information forwarded to the commission (in particular certification of expenditure). they must also check that the erdf funds are used properly, the accounting is accurate and that the financial management is legal, proper and of a high quality in the light of the goals for each form of assistance and of community rules and policies. each programme of checks was drawn up to take account, inter alia, of the inspections made by the commission's financial control and the court of auditors and the results of a risk analysis. the checks confirmed that individual or systematic irregularities continued to occur. in general these relate to the unreliability of certification of expenditure, which are the basis for the payments and advances made by the commission, and the weaknesses of certain internal checking procedures. the declarations of* expenditure often include expenditure not eligible for erdf funding (such as the salaries or operating expenditure of ministries or other public bodies) and expenditure declared as actually incurred sometimes includes estimates of future expenditure. the beneficiaries' declarations of expenditure are in some cases submitted to the commission and certified by the authorities appointed by the member states without sufficient internal checks, which can lead to incorrect submissions and formal irregularities. in addition, in many regions community rules on public procurement are not fully complied with and the programming of assistance is not monitored or assessed with sufficient precision. for example, the legal and financial commitments and payments are not made by the deadlines laid down in the decisions to grant assistance. with the closure of many of the programmes from the first programming period, some weaknesses in the member states' central accounts systems have also come to the fore. as a result of these checks, the commission takes the steps required to monitor and correct all irregularities which it or the court of auditors discovers. the correction often involves deducting the amount deemed ineligible from the member state's subsequent declaration of expenditure for a given programme. esf: 84 inspection.visits, a higher number than in 1995 (73), were carried out to check the use made of esf funding. the checks were made on the basis of an annual programme notified in advance to 108 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the member states, but a certain number of unscheduled visits were also carried out in cooperation with the unit on the coordination of fraud prevention (uclaf). in accordance with article 23(1) of regulation (eec) no 4253/88, as amended, the checks covered the management and control systems established by the member states to ensure correct implementation of the esf operations. this meant that the checks also involved verifying certain operations and visits to the final beneficiaries. improvements were carried out between 1990 and 1995 and appropriate corrective measures were adopted by the member states. nevertheless, weaknesses in the management systems and inadequacies in the control systems are still being detected at various levels of the partnership. inadequacies are still occurring, especially in the assessment of projects, the selection of training bodies, payments in kind, the lack of transparency and publicity for esf aid, disproportionate costs, insufficient spread of responsibilities within the administrations, etc. the esf measures are non-tangible and thus less easy to check. the member states are thus urged to comply with their own control systems and increase the number of on-site inspections they make. eaggf: in 1996, 26 inspection visits were made to check the use made of eaggf funds, a smaller number than in 1995 (35), but more than in 1994 (21). the checks were organised mainly by the departments responsible for the eaggf (22), but also by the financial control of the commission (3) or the member state concerned (1). their main focus was on evaluating the management and control systems used, verifying the conformity of the financial and accounting reports and physical implementation with community rules, the decisions granting aid and the expenditure declared to the eaggf. with the exception of the visits made in two of the three new member states and the expenditure under regulation (eec) no 2328/91, all checks involved programmes and assistance covering the first programming period 1989-93, for which the funds had to be committed by the end of 1993; or where an extension was granted, in 1994 or 1995. as a general rule, the systems introduced by the majority of member states to manage the aid and check declared expenditure function well. nevertheless, a number of weaknesses and irregularities were revealed in almost all of the member states and measures. yet again mention must be made of non-compliance with the community rules on public procurement, the award of aid for ineligible expenditure (by virtue of its nature or the date of payment), major delays in payments to the beneficiaries, a lack of publicity and information about the community funding contribution, inadequate control measures, incorrect application of the conversion rates, a risk of duplicate community funding from different sources for the same measures and uncertainty as to the validity of some commitments entered into before the end of the prescribed period. in the case of two of the new member states, the checks and their outcome were positive overall, since the two countries in question had managed to transpose all the community rules into their national legislation and their national procedures, at times complicated, had ensured that the community rules were correcdy applied. fifg: the departments responsible for the ftfg carried out five visits, two with financial control participation. the construction of a school for divers at kalimnos (greece) was unsatisfactory and an explanation from the greek authorities was expected in early 1997. a visit was made to bremen (germany). no serious irregularity came to light during a visit to portugal (lisbon and p\u00e9niche). letters were sent to the member states in question informing them of the problems encountered and recommending the steps to the taken. as a result, in accordance with article 23 of regulation (eec) no 4253/88, as amended, some member states were asked to make additional checks and to inform the commission of the results. in addition, the commission suggested a number of financial corrections to the programmes or projects in which irregularities had been detected where, under article 24(2) of regulation (eec) no 4253/88, a risk of incorrect use of the community funds had been established. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 109 12. inspections carried out by financial control in 1996 financial control carried out its structural fund inspections in line with the sem 2000 initiative to improve financial management?. this was done on the one hand to rationalise and coordinate the inspections and on the other hand to emphasise further the auditing approach to the control systems introduced by the member states. financial control carried out 75 on-site checks covering total expenditure for the types of assistance audited amounting to ecu 4 200 million. the amounts likely to be recovered total ecu 1 152 000 for the eaggf and ecu 31 780 000 for the esf. the main aim of the programme of inspections was to check the legality, regularity and effectiveness of structural funds transactions and to complete the audit records for each fund and each member state available to financial control. in addition, in order to make better use of the resources of the various inspection authorities and in line with the guidelines adopted by the commission under the sem 2000 programme, negotiations continued in 1996 to extend to the new member states the cooperation protocols concluded between the commission and the relevant national inspection authorities. the detailed discussions with the netherlands made it possible to adapt the protocol formula to the decentralised inspection systems of those member states with a similar structure (in particular the united kingdom, sweden and finland) and those with a federal structure (belgium, germany and austria). in 1996, three new protocols were signed: on 2 february with the netherlands, on 17 june with portugal and on 17 october with sweden. the coordination of inspections received a further boost and coordination meetings were held with seven of the eight member states that had signed a protocol, and with a member state that has not yet signed one. 1.3. enquiries carried out by the anti-fraud unit , \u0142 in addition to the checks carried out under the annual programme referred to above, during 1996 some 40 missions to investigate structural measures were carried out by the commission's anti-fraud unit (uclaf), acting either alone or in association with the departments concerned. the number of enquiries into fraud or suspected fraud carried out by the commission with the member states related to 88 cases, fewer than the 112 in 1995 but concerning a total amount almost four times greater (ecu 88 million instead of ecu 23 million). these investigations included misuse of funds under the renaval programme in the provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur region, where certain councillors have been charged with corruption. it was also found that there was a general failure to monitor th\u00e8\"\"rules on public contracts. another example concerns fisheries policy and the granting of community assistance worth ecu 5.9 million for three projects to establish joint ventures for the priority supply of fisheries products to the community market. there were also a number of cases where costs had been artificially inflated or dummy companies established. this was particularly prevalent in the field of vocational training.3 1.4. notification of irregularities by the member states during 1996, the member states notified to the commission, pursuant to regulation (ec) no 1681/94,4 297 cases of irregularity or fraud involving some ecu 64 million. in volume terms, most cases concerned the esf (129 cases as compared with 106 for the eaggf guidance section, 59 for the erdf and three for the ftfg) but the amount involved was largest in the case of the erdf (about ecu 29.9 million, as compared with ecu 23.6 million for the esf, ecu 10 million for the eaggf guidance section and ecu 330 000 for the ftfg). see below see cases listed in the 1996 annual report on the protection of community financial interests - com(97) 200 final

is compiled in accordance with article 16 of regulation (eec) no 2052/88 as amended and the detailed provisions of article 31 of regulation (eec) no 4253/88 as amended. it presents the application in 1996 of the structural funds regulations, particularly the implementation of their objectives (objectives 1 to 6). the report is structured in accordance with the requirements of the regulations, but also contains some changes. the innovation introduced in the seventh annual report (1995) of dealing with a horizontal subject throughout the report has been retained, the topic chosen for this report being support for technology development. as in previous years too, full treatment has been given to the financial information and the prospects for 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99. the structure of the report continues to evolve, however. for the first time, all the information on the various items of assistance from the structural funds in each member state has been brought together in a single chapter so as to provide an overall - but accurate - view of the structural programmes implemented in each country. similarly, assessment activities have also been covered in a single chapter. the report therefore falls into two main parts. the first - chapters i to iv - takes a general look at what was achieved in 1996 at community level. chapter i covers the implementation of structural assistance in 1996 (community support frameworks and single programming documents, community initiatives, innovative measures) in the context of multiannual programming. this is a presentation for the community as a whole. chapter ii looks at budget implementation in 1996, also in multiannual terms, and other financial issues such as financial management and monitoring of utilisation. it also covers complementarity with the other community policies, a topic which, as in previous years, continues to receive particular attention. chapter tu is devoted to various institutional matters concerning the structural funds, ranging from relations between the community's different institutions to socio-economic and regional partnership and public information on the work of the funds. chapter iv looks at work on assessment in general, both evaluations forming part of structural fund programmes (prior appraisals and interim and ex post evaluations and those carried out on more specific topics (major projects, subject-based assessments, methods of evaluation). the second part of the report - chapters v to x - looks in detail at the implementation of the structural funds, once again from a number of points of view. chapter v deals with programmes and achievements in each member state. the following chapters, which contain only financial tables, give details of financial implementation in 1996 (chapter vi), implementation from 1994 to 1996 (chapter vu), the regional breakdown of financial implementation (chapter vilt), major projects (chapter ix), and erdf and esf pilot projects (chapter x). a. 1996 1. the first cohesion report1 the commission adopted the first report on economic and social cohesion in november 1996. in accordance with article 130b of the ec treaty, which requires a report \"on the progress made towards achieving economic and social cohesion and on the manner in which the various means provided for in this article have contributed to it\". the report analyses progress towards cohesion in the member states, the regions and social groups and the effects on cohesion of the policies of the member states and the union. the member states have demonstrated constant progress towards greater convergence over the last ten years. per capita income in the four poorest member states has risen from 66% of the community average to 74%. unemployment is now the main economic challenge facing member states. although 7 million net jobs have been created over the last ten years, this has not absorbed the increase in the labour force so that the total number unemployed in the union in 1995 was 18 million, a rate of just under 11%. unemployment is particularly high in spain, where it now accounts for one quarter of the labour force, and in finland, where the figure has risen sharply to one-sixth of the labour force. 1 com(96) 542 final of 6 november 1996. ho 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the most common type of irregularity (50% of cases) concerned expenditure for which documents were irregular or missing. of the rest, 11% of irregularities concerned failure to comply with other statutory or contractual conditions and 10% to failure to complete the planned measure; the rest related to miscellaneous irregularities. none of these irregularities should be regarded as minor, since they often conceal more wide-spread phenomena. the ordinary random checks, whether on documents or on the spot carried out by the member states are an effective means of detecting and preventing irregularities (85% of the cases notified). 2. improving financial management in november 1995, as part of the third phase of the sem 2000 initiative, the commission announced its intention to establish a group of personal representatives of the member states' finance and budget ministers (gpr) co-chaired by mrs gradin and mr liikanen, the members of the commission respectively responsible for financial control and the budget. this group has been asked to issue an opinion on the priority measures for improving the financial management of union expenditure managed by the member states. the group met six times in 1996 and studied various aspects of the financial management of the structural funds, including ways to improve implementation and budget forecasts, eligibility rales, programme evaluation, the duties of the member states as regards financial control and the application of financial corrections should irregularities occur. the report of the group was broadly welcomed by the ecoftn council on 11 november and 2 december 1996 and by the european council in dublin on 13-14 december 1996. as regards the rules for eligible expenditure in particular which have until now been a significant source of errors and irregularities, the discussions begun in september 1994 in an internal commission working group chaired by the financial control resulted in the production of 22 data sheets detailing certain types of expenditure and legal concepts5. the document was first presented to the gpr and was then discussed in the various structural funds committees6. a true partnership was thus established and many comments and requests for clarification from the member states were analysed. this process made it possible to amend the data sheets so that they could be used to improve management of the structural funds, thereby reducing irregularities considerably. after these thorough discussion in the gpr and the committees, the commission adopted a draft decision on 19 november 1996 with a view to including the new guidelines on eligibility in all the programming decisions. the draft decision also contained the 22 data sheets defining expenditure eligible under the structural funds. the commission adopted this decision on 23 april 1997 after again consulting the structural funds committees. c. coordination of the various financial instruments 1. cohesion fund article 1 of the regulation establishing the cohesion fund states that the fund may contribute to financing project stages that are technically and financially independent. article 9 of the regulation states that no item of expenditure may benefit from both the cohesion fund and the structural funds. the purpose is to allow the cohesion fund to aid two or more stages of an overall project in tandem with the erdf* since associating the available financial instruments ensures that the funding has maximum impact and helps to speed up the completion of the trans-european networks in particular. this option of staging projects requires close cooperation between the financial instruments. 5 oj no l 146, 5.6.1997. 6 advisory committee on the development and conversion of regions, the committee under article 124 of the treaty (the esf committee), the committee on agricultural structures and rural development (star committee), standing management committee on fisheries structures (see chapter m.a.5. opinion of the committees). 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 111 thorough physical and financial monitoring of the projects is a necessary precondition for achieving this. to avoid any overlap between community aid from different sources, stages that can be identified separately are defined using physical indicators and a specific date is set from which payment applications and supporting documents will be considered for funding. the commission usually accepts only the original invoices as proof. as a result, the same invoice cannot be submitted to two separate financial instruments. in addition, the commission intensifies its inspection visits during the transition from one instrument to another. those responsible for managing the cohesion fund regularly organise inter-departmental meetings with the other financial instruments, the erdf in particular, to ensure the best coordination possible. it goes without saying that the administrative burden in managing projects divided into stages is more complicated than is the case for separate, distinct projects. 2. theeib the goal of economic and social cohesion was assigned to the eib by the treaty on european union. the eib confirms that this goal remains its number one priority. in 1996 bank lending increased by 8.4% over 1995 (as against a rate of 7.5% between 1995 and 1996 and 1.6% between 1993 and 1994). the number of loans contracted in 1996 in the community amounted to ecu 20 946 million as against ecu 18 603 million in 1995 (up 12.6%), ecu 17 682 million in 1994 and ecu 17 724 million in 1993 (5.2% in one year). loans were granted for projects in all the member states, including austria, sweden and finland, where lending operations got off to a strong start. assistance focused on the trans-european networks and on greece, denmark and sweden. performance differed quite markedly from one member state to another when compared with the previous year: there was a strong upswing in italy, greece, the netherlands and germany, but a downswing in spain, denmark and ireland. the concentration of funding in favour of investment in regional development zones, which had eased in 1994 (72.4% in 1994 as against 74.3% in 1993) increased again from 1995 to 1996. concentration is thus higher than the eut s own mid-1996 forecasts. in the regions where development is lagging behind (objective 1) etb loans reached ecu 6 816 million, i.e. 49% of the total for regional development (46% in 1995, 48% in 1994 and 58% in 1993). there has thus been an upswing in activity in these regions compared to 1995 although the levels seen in 1993 have not been reached. funding in the four cohesion countries (greece, spain, ireland and portugal) amounted to ecu 4 477 million, similar to previous years. loan applications doubled in greece and remained stable in portugal but less investment meant fewer applications from spain and ireland. table11-19: eib \u0142 financing for

environmental projects, including urban infrastructure, also increased. projects approved in the energy sector, natural gas in particular, also increased significantly. table 11-20: eib - breakdown by

bank to pay special attention to its activities in the four cohesion countries. 3. ecsc under article 56(2)(a) of the ecsc treaty, the community has at its disposal, until 30 june 1997, a loan instrument for conversion investments to create jobs in areas affected by the reduction of activity and employment in the coal and steel sector. these can be accompanied by interest-rate subsidies -calculated on the basis of the number of jobs created - of up to 3% for five years. in view of the expiry of the ecsc treaty, the commission has decided7 not to consider loan applications received after 31 december 1996. the total amount of new ecsc conversion loans which received the assent of the council in 1996 amounted to ecu 379 600 000 with the number of jobs to be created around 27 000. ecu 37 250 000 was committed under the ecsc budget for 1996 for interest-rate subsidies on current loans. the commission made 85 conversion loans in 1996, 84 of which formed part of global loans amounting to ecu 152 600 000 and 1 was a direct loan for ecu 14 600 000. 4. european investment fund the european investment fund was established in 1994 as a result of a european council decision taken at edinburgh and supports medium and long-term investment in two essential sectors for european economic development: trans-european networks and small firms. as a union institution specialising in granting guarantees, and in coordination with the other institutions and financial instruments, it facilitates private sector participation in trans-european network projects and makes it easier for small firms to get investment funding. in 1996, the loan volume guaranteed amounted to ecu 833 million, half for trans-european networks and half for small firms. as an example of the type of ten funding involved, the eif is playing a significant role in funding improvements to the motorway system in catalonia. in the area of small firms, for example, the eif is guaranteeing, through the merseyside special investment fund - msif, part of the loans granted by a commercial bank to two intermediary funds that reallocate the loans to such firms in this objective 1 region. this eif assistance is in addition to that from the erdf so that the community's contribution to the msif is maximised. in addition, a new eif activity was launched in 1996 in favour of small firms. called the growth and environment pilot project, this european parliament initiative will see the commission and the eif collaborate to facilitate access by small firms to bank loans for environmental investments. the first six decisions were taken in 1996. 7 oj no c 175,28.6.1994. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 113 5. the financial mechanism of the european economic area the agreement on the european economic area provides for a financial mechanism to promote economic and social cohesion in the community to be funded by the efta countries and managed by the eib. its scope is defined in protocol 38 to the agreement: grants totalling ecu 500 million between 1994 and 1998 and 10-year interest-rate subsidies of 2% a year on a total loan volume of ecu 1 500 million. the beneficiaries of the financial mechanism are greece, ireland, northern ireland, portugal and the objective 1 regions of spain (1989-93). as a result of the accession of austria, finland and sweden, their contributions to the mechanism have been taken over by the community budget and the commission is (heading b2-401, ecu 108 million a year). the commission, as the body responsible for the community budget, is thus jointly responsible for the mechanism and is represented on the financial mechanism committee that approves projects. a report on the implementation of the mechanism between 1 january 1995 and 30 june 19968 has been drawn up. in 1996 the interest-rate subsidies concerned ecu 305 million in loans for five projects in spain and one in greece. the committee approved ecu 151 700 000 in grants for two projects in greece, four in spain, one in ireland, one in northern ireland and one in portugal. these were in the three eligible sectors: transport, environment and education and training. table 11-21: financing from the financial mechanism of the european economic area (ecu million) gretce i ireland 1n. ireland i portugal 1 spain i total grants approved. transport

that stress the need for consistency between the community's employment strategy as defined by the european council and the structural funds' activities. this need was set out in the commission communication on community structural assistance and employment9. the structural funds must provide a lasting contribution to employment by creating a better balance between tangible and non-tangible investment. having a number of strategies will allow the funds to improve their effectiveness in combating unemployment by using the funding options offered under the current rules and regulations. appropriate weight must be given to human resources so that the conditions for long-term growth are set in place and the capacity to absorb the changes brought about by technological development are similarly improved. the capacity of economic growth to create greater numbers of jobs must be improved through innovation and by using the job-creation opportunities offered by new socio-economic needs. lastly, com(96) 653 final of 13 december 1996. com (96) 109 final of 20 march 1996. 114 . _____ *th annual r*pon on the structural funds (1996) there needs to be more pro-active intervention in the labour market to deal with the specific problems of the most disadvantaged categories (young job-seekers, long-term unemployed and women). the communication stressed the need to involve all the major partners in this task of assisting the labour market. a the themes of this communication were subsequently contained in the confidence pact for employment10. on the structural funds, the commission suggested that the financial margins for manoeuvre available in the existing programmes should be used to create a special reserve to support employment, that the new guidelines for objective 2 (1997-99) should aim to create employment and that the mid-term review of objectives 1, 3, 4 and 5(b) should be an occasion for fine-tuning operations in support of employment. particular attention should be paid to the development of small firms, not only so that they might turn research and development measures into new activities and jobs but also so that an appropriate framework might be created for local employment initiatives. the confidence pact for employment had the specific aim of encouraging territorial pacts for employment. the european council in florence gave these pacts new political momentum, their guidelines were set in the autumn and most of the member states had submitted proposals for pacts by the end of the year.11 the communication on community structural assistance and employment has also served as a framework for drafting the new guidelines for objective 2 (1997-99) published by the commission on 30 april 1996. the overall aim is to improve production structures - within smes in particular - and workforce skills. the emphasis should be on improving management capabilities and adapting vocational skills so that human resources can contribute to the process of technological and organisational change12. 2. the structural funds and equal opportunities a council resolution of 2 december 199613 stressed the importance of including equal opportunities as a principle of the structural funds. it should be remembered that the structural funds must aid operations that ensure more equal opportunities between men and women. the resolution invites the member states and the commission, in particular through the monitoring committees, to increase the efforts of the structural funds in this regard, to evaluate the funds' contribution to the achievement of more equal opportunities and to take account of this evaluation in future proposals to revise the structural funds regulations. even though some specific measures in the programmes have differing amounts of funding depending on the member state, most states chose a horizontal approach that encourages equal opportunities across all priorities and measures. this makes it hard to give an exact estimate of the funding specifically allocated to equal opportunity measures but it does not mean that there has been a backing away from promoting this priority. there is a general trend towards assisting more complete and integrated operations, due to the expanded scope of the rules and regulations. the accompanying measures are now taken into account, althougn there is still room for improvement in this regard. the concept of a \"route into the jobs market\", broadly developed in current programmes, could also take greater account of the specific constraints on women. the operations undertaken rely heavily, however, on the legislative, socio-economic and cultural make-up of each member state. the ongoing assessment reports will provide more information since concentration on the public and on equal opportunities are specified in the instructions for the evaluators. it will thus be possible to gauge better the first results of the integration of women into this general pclicy. some adjustments to 10 cse (96) 1 final of 5 june 1996. 11 see introduction. a.2. support for employment and chapter itj.b. regional partnership. 12 see

the commission guidelines. in preparing the objective 2 programmes for 1997-99, the commission placed great emphasis on equal opportunities for both erdf and esf funding. the concept seems to be taken into account now to a greater extent than in the past. furthermore, to improve the role and status of women working on agricultural holdings or in a rural setting, in 1996 the commission launched a call for pilot projects under a programme for rural women. the programme has a budget of ecu 20 million over three years (1997-99) and the final date for applications was 20 february 1997. lastly, a leaflet entitled \"women, players in regional development\" was published in 1996 and women entrepreneurs were one of the topics discussed at the northern scandinavia europartenariat. the discussions resulted in the concept of \"resources centres for work enhancement and women's integration into the economy\" and the networking of these centres. this topic was selected to be one of the five activities in the invitation for proposals under recite hi published on 31 october 1996.14 3. the structural funds and the environment the environment continues to play an increasing role in assistance from the structural funds. the 7th annual report (1995) devoted part of each chapter to a discussion of the environment and included numerous examples. as a result of the communication on \"cohesion policy and the environment\" 15 adopted in 1995, structural funds assistance in 1996 was even more marked by the environmental dimension. in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the communication's priorities were discussed on several occasions with the member states in the monitoring committees and in the advisory committee for the conversion and development of the regions16. the priorities in the communication were implemented in 1996 with particular emphasis on environmental issues as set out in the commission guidelines to the member states for the preparation of the new objective 2 programmes17. firstly, the commission stressed the need for a greater number of environmental projects, especially ones that created \"green\" jobs, and preventative measures for environmental protection in environment-related businesses, services, technology and training. secondly, programme approval depended on whether procedural guarantees were in place on the environmental quality of the programmes, such as the involvement of the relevant environmental agencies and improvements in programme/project monitoring and evaluation. in accordance with these guidelines, the new programmes lent much greater weight to preventive environmental operations such as ecological products and environmental research. their most striking feature is the horizontal integration of the environment in various non-environmental priorities and operations. evaluating the impact of the measures on the environment remains however a weak link, and while progress has been made in involving the environmental agencies, the results have not been satisfactory in every instance. similarly, the guidelines for the new interreg iic initiative were adopted by the commission in may 199618 and place particular weight on environmental issues, including cross-border cooperation in land planning, combating drought and floods and the management of waterways. in the case of the programmes currently under way, the commission organised training courses for its own staff and launched environmental training seminars for structural fund administrators in the 14 see chapter i.b.2. innovative measures and technical assistance. 15 com (95) 509 final of 22 november 1995. 16 in the case of the cohesion fund, the commission has made progress towards the goal of dividing assistance equally between investments in transport and the environment. the share of total commitments devoted to environmental projects increased from 48.5% to 49.9% in 1996. 17 see chapter i.a.3. objective 2. 18 see chapter i.b. 1. community initiatives. 116 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) objective 1 regions. the first such seminar was held in ireland in november 1996 and similar activities were in preparation for 1997. furthermore, to identify the prevention measures and best practices, the commission carried out a study in 1996 on sustainable development and employment in the objective 2 regions. this study, which ended at the start of 1997, includes 20 examples of good practice and illustrates for funds administrations the possible measures that might be taken to promote sustainable development. a booklet entitled \"the environment and the regions: towards sustainable development\" was also produced19. finally, in the longer term, the preparatory work on the european spatial development perspective (esdp) is looking at the issue of prudent management of the natural heritage and its development. alongside this, the commission has initiated a strategy study of water resources in the mediterranean basin to be carried out by the i.p.t.s. (institute for prospective technological studies), seville, which will be of major importance when thinking about the next programming period for the structural funds and for work on the perspective. 4. the structural funds, the common agricultural policy and rural development structural funds and the common agricultural policy since agriculture is still one of the main activities for many regions of the community, most of the programmes for 1994-99 include measures relating to the sector. it is therefore essential to ensure that the measures proposed by the member states in the development plans for rural areas under objectives 1, 6 or 5(b) are compatible with the guidelines of the cap while equally considering the contribution which agricultural measures make to the development of economic activity. in the case of objective 5(b), the agricultural measures were planned in the spds with due regard to the necessary complementarity between the reform of the cap and rural development. while the planned measures to ensure that a sufficient number of farmers remain on the land contribute to the socio-economic development of the rural areas, the commission has also required certain guarantees. in general, every time a national aid scheme is proposed, it is always examined for compatibility with current cap rules and the rules on state aids. the priority operations selected involve the application of new technology, energy savings, quality promotion, etc. in irrigation, for example, priority has been given to the improvement of existing structures to prevent water loss (through evaporation, leaks, etc.) without changing the area actually irrigated. when it became apparent that new irrigation was involved, the commission strictly limited the newly irrigated areas and asked to be informed of the intended crops. the same approach was followed under objective 5(a) with regard to the structures for both production and marketing. the trends on agricultural markets require farm holdings and the production and marketing structures for agricultural products to make constant adjustments. the objective 5(a) measures seek to ease the adjustments so as to improve agricultural competitiveness. by maintaining jobs in agriculture and in those sectors downstream of it, the measures help in the development of the rural areas. many procedures have been implemented to ensure that the measures are consistent with the cap guidelines. in the case of investment aid, restrictions have been imposed in certain sectors to avoid creating surpluses (pigmeat, eggs and poultrymeat, beef and veal). in the case of processing and marketing, priority is given to certain types of investment: to protect the environment for example, introduce technological innovation or improve health quality and conditions, and the commission has set selection criteria on the basis of community policy guidelines, in particular those of the cap. in some sectors, investment aid was prohibited (tobacco, fodder crops) or authorised subject to strict limits, sometimes accompanied by a requirement to reduce capacity (slaughter, regrouping of enterprises in the wine and spirits sectors). 19 euroffice, 1996. cx-90-95-744-c. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) _ 117 the challenges facing rural society more generally, the community has introduced a specific policy for rural areas. rural society is undergoing far-reaching changes and is increasingly subject to pressures which threaten an already delicate balance. predominantly rural areas account for more than 80% of community territory and over a quarter of its population. the prosperity and environment of rural communities are increasingly threatened while agriculture, the main activity in a large number of rural areas, is going through a crisis which at times calls into question their very existence. the treaty on european union takes account of the problems of the rural areas. article 130a of the treaty provides that the community should reduce \"disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions, including rural areas\". the programmes implemented for the second structural funds programming period have enabled a strategy to be set in place to develop the economy of the rural areas through the diversification of both agricultural and non-agricultural activities. the strategy's multi-sectoral character, its emphasis on innovation and bottom-up approach all contribute to maintaining or creating employment. to prepare for the next structural funds period, it was thought useful to take a detailed look at the future of rural society and the challenges it faces: economic globalisation, the continuing reform of the cap, wto negotiations, the foreseeable enlargement of the european union, the appearance of new technologies. these issues were focused on in particular at a conference in cork (ireland) on 7, 8 and 9 november 1996 which brought together policy makers and specialists from the 15 member states of the union, from the countries of central europe, the mediterranean countries, the usa and japan. the conference confirmed that agriculture and forestry represent the two most important forms of land use in rural areas, that agriculture remains a major interface between people and the environment, but that the relative importance of farming and forestry continues to decline and rural development must accordingly concern itself with all socio-economic sectors operating in a rural environment. the conference concluded that sustainable rural development had to be a priority for the union and that rural development policy should check the flight from the land, fight poverty, promote employment and equal opportunities, meet requirements with regard to quality, safety, personal development and leisure, improve living standards in rural areas and preserve the quality of the environment. this policy, some aspects of which it should prove possible to apply in all the union's rural areas, should be based on an integrated and multisectoral approach which encourages the diversification of economic and social activities while ensuring sustainable rural development in order to safeguard the quality of the countryside. rural development policy should also comply with the principle of subsidiarity by encouraging those involved at the lowest levels and their initiatives (the 'bottom up' approach) in order to take better account of the great variety of rural areas. it should encourage synergies between public and private finance to promote productive investment, help small and medium-sized firms and encourage research and innovation. 5. the structural funds and the common fisheries policy since 1994, the year marking the incorporation of the common fisheries policy into the structural funds, the instruments mobilised to assist fisheries structures have had a dual purpose. on the one hand, they seek to ensure the survival and sustainable development of the common policy by helping the fishing effort to adapt to. the resources that are actually there. on the other hand, the instruments help to strengthen economic and social cohesion through aid to reinforce the structures in the fishing industry as a whole: the fleet, aquaculture, processing and marketing of products and port facilities. furthermore, measures financed by the ftfg in relation to the fishing fleet must comply with the objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes (mgps), which place restrictions on the fishing effort of each member state. in particular aid for the construction of new fishing vessels is authorised only where the annual intermediate objectives of the mgp, and subsequently the final objectives, are observed. 118 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 6. the structural funds and smes structural funds assistance to smes continued to increase in 1996. on the one hand, the preparation of the objective 2 programmes for 1997-9920 made their development one of the priorities in the commission's guidelines that had to be reflected in the spds submitted by the member states. a reference to the new definition of an sme was introduced to standardise usage both at community and national level, in accordance with the commission recommendation on the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises21. on the other hand, as regards the smes initiative, 1996 saw the adoption of a large number of new programmes22, and the ones already adopted were closely monitored in the monitoring committees. the programmes for the objective 1 regions that focused most on smes, such as the \"industry\" ops for ireland, italy, portugal and greece, were monitored in particular by the departments responsible for enterprise policy, so that the smes would be considered when implementing the programmes. in addition, under the reserve for the smes initiative, the commission proposed three types of operation to encourage cross-border activity: exchanges of experiences and good working practices between the member states in spheres of activity identified in advance, aid for buyer's exhibitions, and aid to get tourism enterprises connected to the internet (teletourism).23 ibex: international buyer's exhibition the ibex concept was launched as part of the community's enterprise policy with a view to trying out a formula whereby large and small firms could meet to discuss the demand requirements of the former. the concept was adopted by the regional policy through the smes initiative which promotes the holding of ibex exhibitions in the regions eligible under the structural funds, and objective 1 regions iri particular. ibex exhibitions focus on the needs identified by large enterprises and the specific capacity of the smes to satisfy those needs. this identification of supply and demand centres on a particular sector (cars, agri-food, textiles, timber, etc) and is intended to assist large enterprises in the search for partner smes with a view to specific cooperation while at the same time offering smes an opportunity to make direct contact with large enterprises interested in their products, services or know-how. ibex exhibitions optimise these contacts and offer the participants savings of both time and money when compared to traditional subcontracting exhibitions. as part of the enterprise policy, the third multiannual programme for smes (1997-2000)24 adopted in 1996 seeks in particular to simplify and improve the financial, legislative and administrative environment for businesses and to help smes to plan their business strategies in international terms, improve their competitiveness and improve their access to research, innovation and training. particular attention was paid in this regard to improving sme access to the structural funds. the council twice sought25 to improve the business environment and stimulate business support measures, in particular by improving sme access to the community programmes, including the structural funds. in addition, where trade and distribution are concerned, the importance of local businesses in rural areas got the commission thinking about ways to use the structural funds (the erdf in particular) to maintain and 20 21 22

regional policy and enterprise policy initiatives for the benefit of smes the structural funds and the euro-info-centres: within the network of 250 euro-info-centres, a subgroup of 49 elcs in the 15 member states specialises in the structural funds. in addition to meetings providing information and an exchange of views on the smes initiative and inter-regional cooperation under article 10 of the erdf regulation, die subgroup made a collection in 1996 of german and italian \"success stories\" for example. the specialist eics relay information for the commission and offer technical advice to the local, regional and national authorities on the planning and implementation of programmes aided by the structural funds. europartenariat, a display of enterprise partnership : the europartenariat programme was launched by the commission in 1987 as part of its regional and enterprise policies. it encourages smes in the eligible regions (objectives 1, 2, 5(b) and 6) to make business contacts with one another and to cooperate with enterprises in other member states or third countries. the erdf part-finances the events by ecu 1 million under article 10 of die erdf regulation. since europartenariat was first launched, close on 22 000 enterprises have been able to make contact and discuss possible cooperation agreements covering trade, finance, technology, franchising, joint-ventures, etc. two europartenariat events were held in 1996 : \u0142 europartenariat lule\u00e2 (sweden, 13-14 june 1996): \"northern scandinavia 1996\" brought together more than 1 500 smes from 50 countries. it was the first europartenariat organised in one of the new member states. the 386 swedish, finnish and norwegian enterprises in the region made some 7.500 contacts with the 1 200 visiting firms, 225 of which came from the countries of central and eastern europe (ceec) and 160 from the newly independent states. several seminars took place, including a particularly successful conference on women entrepreneurs. \u0142 europartenariat genoa (italy, 27-29 november 1996): \"italia 96,% brought together 406 smes in the objective 2 areas of italy that were thus able to meet more than 2 000 other smes. over 12 000 contacts were made between the host and visiting enterprises. in addition to a large delegation of enterprises from the ceec, the newly independent states and the mediterranean basin, europartenariat genoa also included for the first time significant numbers of enterprises from asia, latin america and the united states; more than 70 countries were represented. aid for european sme business and innovation centres (ec-bics) (business and innovation centres -bics): this programme is funded under article 7 of the erdf regulation and assists die creation of innovative enterprises and the modernisation and development of existing smes. twenty two ec-bics were promoted by the programme in 1996. most of these were located in objective 1 or 2 areas (six and nine respectively) but four were in objective 5(b) areas and three in objective 6 areas. as in the past, the erdf part-financed activities to prepare, organise and launch the new centres and provided technical assistance to the management teams as they were set up. this brings the total number of ec-bics in the ebn (european business and innovation centre network) to about 140. the \u00abseed capital\u00bb pilot project, 5 years on: this pilot plan was adopted by the commission in 1988 as part of its regional and enterprise policies. in january 1996, 23 investment funds were operating under the plan, all of which had been created between 1990 and 1993. the funds qualified for five years for repayable advances covering 50% of their operating costs. fifteen of these in eligible regions also received an injection of capital through die business and innovation centres mentioned above. the funds, based in 8 member states27, are independent bodies governed by private law with responsibility for their investment decisions. three funds have a cross-border dimension28. they all now form the kernel of the european seed capital fund network (escfn) which comprises 50 funds. 7. the structural funds and tourism tourism is one sector in which structural funds assistance is of major importance both financially in all eligible regions and in terms of its contribution to the diversification of the local economy. the 26 com(96) 530 final of 20 november 1996. 27 belgium, germany, spain, france, ireland, italy, netherlands, united kingdom. 28 they cover respectively: benelux; france and spain; saarland, lorraine and luxembourg. 12 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the regions at the centre of the union are considerably richer than those on the periphery, i.e. greece, southern italy, southern spain, portugal, ireland, northern finland, the new lander, the french overseas departments. the 25 richest regions have an average per capita income two and a half times greater than the poorest regions and the situation has hardly changed in this respect over time. in 1995 the unemployment rate in the 25 worst hit regions was 22.4%, almost five times higher than in the 25 least affected regions (4.6%). there is a high concentration of unemployment at sub-regional level, particularly in urban areas, where the numbers unemployed may account for between one third and one half of the labour force. disparities in income are caused not only by geographical but also by social factors. this report looks at the proportion of the population living below.the poverty line (defined as an income of 50% or less of the national figure). at the end of the 80s, the highest figures in this regard were recorded in portugal (27%), italy (22%), greece (20%), spain (17%) and the united kingdom (17%). poverty appears to be increasing slightly, although it has fallen in some of the poorest member states (ireland, spain and portugal). poverty is frequently related to unemployment, which itself has a substantial impact on society: in the first half of 1996, the rate of unemployment among young people under 25 years of age was 21%, double the average for all age groups together where it stood at 12.5% for women and 9.5% for men. the most worrying feature is the \"hard core\" of long-term unemployed: in 1995,49% of people out of work had been looking for a job for a year or more. the report also looks at the impact of national policies on cohesion. from a macroeconomic viewpoint, the member states have, in general, made considerable progress in bringing inflation and interest rates under control and reducing the public debt and deficits. these results are important, because they are a pre-condition for increased investment and the success of cohesion policies. the regional policies of the member states also make a contribution, but expenditure is concentrated mainly in the richest countries. between 1989 and 1993, germany and italy alone accounted for two thirds of total expenditure on regional development. it should also be noted that budgetary restrictions generally result in a fall in national expenditure on regional policy. the main means of fighting poverty are national policies on taxation and public expenditure. typical figures for these net transfers are 4% of gdp from regions which are net contributors and 8% of gdp to those which are net beneficiaries. these transfers have had a substantial influence on regional and social cohesion and have reduced income disparities within the member states by an average of 23%. combined with national efforts, the union's cohesion policies have helped create a new situation in europe which gives the less-favoured regions and social groups new opportunities. assistance from the structural funds has had a significant impact on per capita income, for example, by increasing growth in the four poorest countries by half a percentage point per year. it is also estimated that it has resulted in over 600 000 net new jobs in those countries and 530 000 in the old industrial areas eligible under objective 2, which in both cases means a reduction in unemployment rates of about 2.5%. an in-depth study of the rural areas eligible under objective 5(b) in 20 regions shows that the population has stabilised in about half of them and has even increased in six others. income fell in only two of those regions. by assisting the poorest regions, community policies have increased the economic potential of the whole union. estimates suggest, for example, that for every ecu 100 spent in the objective 1 regions, ecu 30 to 40 return to benefit other regions through their exports to the objective 1 regions. as for the community policies other than cohesion, it appears that wherever expenditure is substantial, some if not most of the poorest countries and regions have been among the main beneficiaries. the common agricultural policy is the most significant example since it accounted for almost half the community budget in 1994. the 1992 cap reform benefited the cohesion countries since three of these four countries (greece, spain and ireland) are, alongside france and denmark, among the main beneficiaries. the impact on regional cohesion is positive, since there is a financial transfer from urban areas (which are generally richer) to rural areas (which are generally poorer). nevertheless, estimates prior to the reform suggest that these transfers have benefited mainly a limited 120 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) commission published in 1996 a document entitled \"tourism and the european union: a practical guide\"29, which identifies all the community financial instruments that can be mobilised for tourism purposes, first among which are the structural funds. the document shows the important place occupied by tourism in structural funds spending and gives an overview of the significant contribution of this activity to strengthening economic, social and regional cohesion. in this regard, in addition to developing the quantitative analysis of the volume and structure of financial assistance, special attention needs to be paid in 1997 to perfecting the tools for evaluating the quality of tourism's contribution to achieving cohesion. at the same time and with a view to improved coordination of financial assistance to tourism (a requirement identified by the court of auditors in its special report on tourism policy and promotion) additional measures will be taken to evaluate in a more detailed and systematic manner the impact of the structural policies on tourism and identify the main steps required to boost the quality and competitiveness of european tourism30. it should be noted that the implementation of the community action plan for tourism (1993-95), which the commission evaluated in a report in 1996, identified numerous points of convergence between structural assistance and specific tourism measures, both in sectoral terms and the operating approach.31 8. the structural funds and energy the availability of adequate supplies of energy at reasonable prices is essential to the competitiveness of regions whose development is lagging behind. a good energy balance, the rational use of energy and stress on the development of renewable sources of energy are also important considerations for territorial planning. almost all the objective 1 csfs include a section oh energy and of their total funding some ecu 2.4 billion (2.7% of the budget for that objective) is allocated to energy projects for the period 1994-99.32 while these projects contribute to the main aim of regional development, they also comply with the priorities of the community's energy policy: security of supply, the competitiveness of european firms and the compatibility of energy and environmental aims.33 the projects financed are mainly concerned with more efficient energy use, the diversification of sources of energy, the development of renewable sources of energy, cost reduction, improved transport and distribution of energy and the protection of the environment in activities relating to the production, processing, transport and utilisation of energy. furthermore, some community initiative programmes are directly concerned with energy. the regen strand of interreg ii contains provision for completing measures begun under the earlier programme on energy networks (regen) and the promotion of cross-border cooperation projects for the distribution of gas and electricity and the use of renewable sources of energy. in the most remote regions, the regis initiative covers investment in energy-saving materials and local energy production and the training of staff in the field of energy. outside the structural funds, the union finances specific energy programmes designed to achieve the goal of cohesion. for example, one third of the measures under thermie (the demonstration strand of the joule-thermie programme on non-nuclear research and development) and almost half the local and 29 european commission, 1996, opoce.

france: ecu 10 million; ireland: ecu 70 million; italy: 312 million; portugal: ecu 322 million; united kingdom: ecu 182 million. 33 see the commission communication 'an overall view of energy policy

carried out in objective 1 regions and over 20% in areas eligible under objectives 2 and 5(b). 9. the structural funds and trans-european networks under title xii of the treaty on european union, two main aims lie behind the construction of trans-european transport, energy and telecommunications networks: to improve the working of the single market and to foster economic and social cohesion. the tens seek to connect networks together and make them operationally compatible, improve access to them and carry out projects of common interest, taking particular account of the need to connect the islands and isolated, peripheral regions to the community's core. the tens are implemented on the basis of community guidelines identifying projects of common interest. based on the regulation on tens funding adopted in 199534, the community contributes to work on projects of common interest by part-funding feasibility studies, offering loan guarantees, interest-rate subsidies and, in duly justified cases, direct grants. the tens have a budget line of ecu 2 345 million for the period 1995-9935. community funding is mainly intended to overcome the financial obstacles that can occur at the start of a project. significant progress was made in 1996 on the tens. the union's financial contribution was appreciably higher in 1996 than in 1995 and the role of the tens in improving the unemployment situation was acknowledged, in particular in the european confidence pact for employment. other measures and/or initiatives improved the operating climate for the tens, examples being the start made to liberalising the electricity market, the reopening of negotiations to liberalise the market in gas, the commission's green and white papers on internationalisation of the external costs of the transport infrastructures, the \"citizen's network\" and the relaunch of rail transport. some difficulties remain36, nevertheless, in particular with regard to the budget for work on 14 specific (or priority) transport projects identified at the european council in essen in 1994. issues are still addressed from a national perspective instead of being resolved at community level in an integrated way and with networks and systems in mind. difficulties have also arisen over establishing public-private partnerships, transport charges, public procurement and the european company statute. on tens legislation, the guidelines on transport and energy networks were adopted on 23 july, as was the directive on the interoperability of the trans-european high-speed rail system37. the member states were less inclined to proceed with environmental network projects as part of the criteria laid down for water and waste. since 1993, the tens are explicitly eligible for erdf funding, which has now become the main source of community funding (more than ecu 5 billion for 1994-99), and for cohesion funding (more than ecu 7 billion in the same period). the erdf funds tens projects, or (secondary) projects providing access to tens in eligible areas while the cohesion fund finances tens transport projects in greece, ireland, portugal and spain. a number of projects of common interest in the guidelines, including several projects that the european council in essen in december 1995 deemed a priority, are funded under the objective 1 csfs. attempts are made to co-ordinate the assistance as much as possible with the other community financial instruments, such as the tens budget line, eeb loans and eif guarantees by setting up committees of representatives of the member states, holding internal consultations or publishing a schematic plan for monitoring funding. since 1993 the eeb and the eif have also contributed more than ecu 20 billion in loans and loan guarantees for tens funding. the commission has stressed38 the need to improve coordination in the member states between the national administrations in charge of transport and the national, regional and local authorities that channel assistance from the structural funds. 34 council regulation (ec) no 2236/95 of 18 september 1995. 35 1995 prices. 36 see the 1996 annual report on trans-european networks,

trans-european transport networks the guidelines for the trans-european transport networks were adopted by the council and parliament on 23 july 199639. their goal is to introduce by 2010 a multimodal network offering modern, efficient infrastructure for economic activity and a wide variety of rapid and reliable transport options helping to absorb the increasing traffic in goods and passengers and establishing the best connections for the peripheral and remotest regions. in terms of the projects already under way, steady progress has been made by most of the 14 specific projects identified by the european council in essen. in 1996, the commission committed ecu 280 million to the tens budget line for transport projects of common interest, 75% of which went on the specific projects in accordance with the conclusions of the cannes european council in june 1995. of the priority and specific projects, a number receive significant joint-funding from the erdf and the cohesion fund: main roads in ireland, northern ireland and italy, athens-thessaloniki rail link, the via egnatia and pathe motorways (patras-athens-thessaloniki) which has made appreciable progress since the tender for two sub-projects was awarded, and the cork-dublm-belfast rail link, which should be completed in 1996-97. trans-european energy networks the tens guidelines for gas and electricity were adopted by the parliament and council on 5 june 199540 j0 adjust to the rapid changes in the energy sector in europe and to take account of the accession of austria, finland and sweden, in july 1996 the commission presented a proposal41 supplementing the first list of 43 projects of common interests mentioned in the guidelines with 31 new projects. the proposal was adopted in june 1997. the essen european council moreover identified ten priority projects among the 43 in the guidelines. la the gas sector, appreciable progress was achieved in 1996 on the gas pipeline projects assisted by the erdf in greece, spain and portugal in particular, to which the eib also granted substantial loans. the projects involve: \u0142 construction of the algeria-morocco-spain pipeline in spain, with spur lines to certain towns and cities in andalusia; \u0142 the introduction of natural gas to more spanish towns and cities (the western gas pipeline project and the valencia-orihuela-cartagena project); \u0142 the introduction of natural gas to portugal and interconnection of the portuguese and spanish networks; \u0142 the main pipeline in the project to introduce natural gas to greece, which has already been built, and funding of the remaining work to built the high-pressure gas supply network. the work is being carried out with a loan from the elb; \u0142 the connector between eastern germany and western poland and the start of work on the other sections in germany and poland, part of the russia-belarus-poland-european union pipeline. most of the electricity projects on the other hand have yet to get permission or comply with environmental standards. this is the case for the electricity interconnection projects between france, spain and italy and between italy and greece. only the electricity connector between northern portugal and spain is partly operational and this project and is not yet complete. as regards financial assistance from the tens budget line to projects of common interest identified in the guidelines, in 1996 the commission decided to grant ecu 8 900 000 to part-finance studies, 45% of which went on projects in spain, portugal, greece and ireland. 39

preparing the conciliation procedure for the overall guidelines for trans-european telecommunications networks. the guidelines, which supplement the ones already in force for the integrated services digital network (euro-isdn), highlight applications and services meeting the socio-economic needs of the users and focus in particular on those areas of public interest where telecommunications provide innovative solutions: multimedia for education and culture, data transmission links between those involved in health care, value-added services for transport system users and data transmission services for smes. along with euro-isdn, the guidelines cover all advanced and mobile networks and the preparatory work on the move to broadband (ibc) networks. the erdf is funding expansion of the physical networks. it is similarly contributing ecu 173 million to the development of the isdn-tens in greece under the telecommunications op. funding of the tens telecommunications activities in 1996 from the tens budget line was based on the 1995 guidelines and was aimed at developing euro-isdn. the activities funded included the selection, after a call for proposals published on 13 april 1996, of 11 advanced telecommunications services and applications projects of socio-economic relevance covering such aspects as urban information networks, telemedicine, teleinformation, teleworking, cultural services from a remote site and electronic trading for smes. the community contribution to these projects was ecu 18 100 000. it is impossible to calculate the extent to which these funds actually benefited the cohesion countries as the beneficiaries in each case were ad hoc consortia formed of companies from different member states. 10. the structural funds and the transparency of public contracts in the annual report for 1995, the commission stressed the need to be close geographically to project decision-makers so that the preparation of the project case files, their monitoring, the speed of implementation and understanding of community documents might all be improved. as information on public procurement is available at national, regional or local level, monitoring must also act as an aid to the decision-makers and thus be carried out at the appropriate level. as previously stated, the commission gave thought to this issue and it consequently adopted in november 1996 the green paper on public procurement.42 1997 was spent collecting the comments of the economic actors and preparing the framework for the physical implementation of the proposed approaches. on monitoring assistance part-financed by the structural funds, the green paper has a number of innovative proposals to make. two chapters are of direct relevance to the contracts receiving community assistance: the issue of \"attestation\" in the chapter on the application of public procurement law and the issue of procurement involving union funds in the chapter on public procurement and other community policies the commission has suggested creating at national level independent bodies monitoring public procurement rules, increased use of the procedure certifying compliance with community legislation on public procurement (already provided for in the remedies directive) and making public procurement decision makers accountable. movement in this sense does not mean that commission would give up its rights in this regard; it will continue to monitor public procurement in accordance with the treaty and the directives. in the case of the checks carried out on the award of public tenders funded by the erdf in the 1989-93 period, the commission received \"public procurement questionnaires\" completed by the bodies carrying out the projects and returned along with the applications for the payment of outstanding balances as laid down in the structural funds regulations. using these questionnaires, the commission knows when a notice of public works contract to carry out these projects is published in the official journal, thereby allowing it to scrutinise all relevant information. in the case of the public 42 com(96) 583 final of 27 november 1996. 124 _ 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) procurement procedures used for awarding contracts, the documents enabled the commission to carry out more detailed investigations using the records of awards. 11. the structural funds and competition policy under articles 92 and 93 of the treaty, the commission keeps under review public aid to firms in so far as it distorts competition and affects trade between member states. when examining regional aid for compatibility with the single market, the commission pays particular attention to its potentially beneficial effects on the economic development of the least-developed regions, provided that the terms of competition and trade between member states are not affected to an extent contrary to the common good. these principles are applied not only when specific aid schemes are being scrutinised but also to the horizontal arrangements. thus, in line with the guidelines adopted in recent years, more favourable treatment is reserved for this type of aid under the various provisions adopted in 1996. in particular, both the community rules on state aid for research and development43 and for smes44 provide for an increase in the acceptable intensity of aid if the projects are located in a region eligible for structural funding. since a significant proportion of the aid from the structural funds benefits firms directly, it is also important to ensure that the community's regional policy is carried out in full conformity with the rules on competition. the commission must take account of the effect any cumulation of state aids and community funding will have on competition and trade. with this in mind, in 1996 the commission examined the measures in the objective 2 spds for the period 1997-99 for compatibility with the treaty. in addition, the commission's efforts to improve consistency and coordination between community and national regional policies continued in 1996 through the analysis of maps of regions eligible for regional aid. new maps were approved for germany, luxembourg and the netherlands. in each case, interest focused mainly on the percentage of the population covered and the intensity of aid. on that occasion the commission made sure that coverage in terms of the eligible population was such that greater concentration of the aid was achieved overall so that its economic impact was maximised, its effect on competition was contained and limited budget resources were used more effectively. on the other hand, the commission ensured that the ceilings for aid were differentiated depending on the relative macro-economic standing of the regions concerned. in the first report on economic and social cohesion45, the commission felt that the principle of overall concentration of the aid in the least-favoured regions could be even more resolutely applied, in particular by improving consistency between the identification of regions eligible under the structural funds and the decisions on eligibility for national aid, and it intends to continue in this vein. in this regard, eligibility under the structural funds (in the case in point, the urban community initiative) has been made an additional criterion for the eligibility of certain areas for national aid falling within community rules on state aid to firms in disadvantaged urban areas. 43 oj no c

commission examined the new schemes and the amendments which, in accordance with the agreements on accession, were made to the schemes existing at the time of accession to bring them into line with community rules before 1997. most notably, in 1996 the commission approved an aid scheme for transport in the northern regions of finland to take account of the special regional development problems resulting from the area's low population density. this is the first case applying the provisions set out in its communication on the application of article 92(3)(c) of the treaty relating to state aid for regional purposes46. 12. the structural funds, education and training two main approaches were followed in 1996 to ensure coordination between the structural funds -the esf in particular - and the community's programmes on education and training: in the first place coordination was maintained between the esf's activities, in particular its employment and adapt community initiatives, and the two extensive education and training programmes socrates and leonardo da vinci; secondly, specific initiatives were undertaken to promote a community-wide debate on essential education and training policies. the place of education and training in the community's employment strategy has generally remained a central concern, as evidenced by the various activities undertaken. in terms of actual programming, the provisions on coordination in the socrates and leonardo da vinci programmes remained applicable so that consistent approaches might be adopted for the selection of projects under the community initiatives and for funding under article 6 of the esf regulation. more generally, complementarity between the policy guidelines focused on four commission education and training initiatives, i.e. the european year of lifelong training and education (1996); the white paper teaching and learning: towards the learning society, which resulted in proposals on employability, social exclusion and a strengthening of cooperation between schools and the world of work; the commission task force responsible for educational software and multimedia drafted a final working paper in july47 and a joint invitation for proposals in december 1996; lastly, the commission proposal \"learning and the information society: action plan for a european education initiative\", which proposes structural fund aid for the policies set out in the proposal. 13. the structural funds and culture culture is a job-creating sector of the economy identified by the commission in its white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment. having presented its first report on the consideration of cultural aspects in european community action48, which includes a presentation of the various types of structural funding available, in november 1996 the commission adopted a communication entitled \"cohesion policy and culture: a contribution to employment\"49, in which it stressed that culture was not only a costly public activity but also an increasing economic sector in its own right. the document identifies the interaction between regional development and culture and emphasises the importance that culture can have in creating jobs. culture can in fact fulfil three major regional development functions since cultural activities and development linked to the cultural heritage are a source of direct and indirect employment, culture is an important element for a region's image region and the establishment of economic activities and, lastly, it can be a factor in boosting and integrating social activities. 46 oj no c 364, 20.12.1994. 47 sec (96) 1426 of 23 july 1996. 48 com(96) 160 final of 17 april 1996. 49 com (96) 512 final of 20 november 1996. 726 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) while it is difficult to provide exact figures, the structural funds are the most important instruments for funding cultural projects. the communication concludes therefore that, in future, culture must be more fully integrated into the local and regional development strategies so that they can have maximum effect on employment and innovation. while the cultural heritage has already benefited greatly from the funds, greater attention must henceforth be paid to cultural activities and their exploitation as a source of income. 126 bis 8lh annual report on the structural funds (1996) 14. the structural funds and disability following the commission's communication ', the council adopted on 20 december 1996 a resolution on equal opportunities for the disabled. this document drew special attention to changing attitudes to disabled persons at both european and wider international level2 and made the following points: i \u0142 disabled persons form a significant proportion (37 million) of the community's population; \u0142 social cohesion in the european community implies promotion of equal opportunities and removing any discrimination against such persons; \u0142 access to properly-linked education and training is a necessary condition for successful integration into social and economic life. with an unemployment rate two to three times above the average for the population as a whole, disabled people must be the subject of a special effort via well thought out measures for their social and professional integration. since 1989, the structural funds have been working for economic and social cohesion in all regions of the union. the fight against unemployment and the creation of jobs are held to be a special priority. the structural funds, and in particular the esf. are a vital element of the commission's strategy of implementing a combination of programmes in favour of equal opportunities. in total, 5.5 thousand million ecus from the structural funds are targeted against social exclusion in the 1994-99 period under objectives 1, 2 and 3. specifically for disabled persons, the fse is contributing some 1.3 thousand million ecus (1996) via its \"mainstream\" actions (765 million ecus) and via the employment / horizon community initiative (513 million ecus). horizon aims at an integrated approach (partnership between social actors and local/regional/national authorities) and supports four types of measure: training, job creation, guidance and new technologies. given the special theme of the present report, it is interesting to note that one fifth of the horizon projects concern new technologies and distance-working. in its 1997 mid-term evaluation of the structural funds, the commission will seek to assess the impact of measures in favour of the disabled. com(96)406of30july 1996. 2 cf. the united nations general assembly resolution 48/46 of 20 december 1993 for the promotion of the principle of equal

to a lesser extent than if the commission's proposal to cap direct aids had been accepted. the cohesion report shows that all regions and all sections of society may benefit from those community policies where expenditure is lower but which create a climate for change. however, the more central regions and the more advantaged social groups are often better placed to do so. for example, the single market has had a considerable impact on competitiveness throughout the union, despite unfounded fears that it would prove crushing for the poorer countries. spain, portugal and ireland in particular have seen their chances of finding export opportunities grow. however, as regards trade and investment, the position of greece and southern italy has scarcely improved. turning to transport networks, the countries eligible under the cohesion fund have seen improvements in passenger transport although it is true that the countries at the centre of the community, at the very heart of the transport network, benefit still more from these policies. in the case of telecommunications networks, the infrastructure required to develop the information society is less advanced in the poor regions, which undoubtedly threatens to widen the gap between rich and poor regions in this respect2. the cohesion report concludes by looking at ways of making the policies more effective. here too, the watchword is shared responsibilities. the member states must take the initiatives required to reduce public debt while maintaining programmes based on investment, growth and job creation; the community policies other than cohesion policy can in turn improve synergies and coordination with the goals of cohesion. the structural funds should concentrate more on the most serious problems and the regions in difficulty. administrative procedures require simplification and the system of monitoring and evaluation must be made more rigorous. the partnership with those involved at regional and local level and with the private sector could be developed. finally, the structural funds must give priority to combating unemployment and creating lasting jobs and the instruments used must reflect this priority. 2. support for employment during 1996 the employment situation remained a major cause for concern within the union. the guidelines for macroeconomic policy offer a consistent framework for a lasting solution to employment problems, and the multiannual programmes of the member states adopted in accordance with the recommendations of the essen and madrid european councils are of the utmost importance, since they embody strategic commitments to making the labour market more efficient and increasing investment in human resources. these practical policies therefore ensure synergy with assistance from the structural funds. in its communication on community structural assistance and employment3, the commission pointed to the growing need to ensure consistency between the strategy of the union and the measures in the member states part-financed by the structural funds. that communication is part of the confidence pact for employment4, which seeks in particular to use the available financial margins in various ways: to support innovative measures for small firms: to improve the dynamic management of employment and investment in human resources: to increase compatibility between working life and family life; and to promote local initiatives for development and employment. the confidence pact also stresses the need to improve the political, economic and social partnership in order to improve the way local potential is used to encourage job creation. in 1996, implementation of this framework for action took two main directions. on the one hand, the communication on community structural assistance and employment provided a basis for the commission's guidelines to the member states in preparation for the second phase of programming for objective 2 (\\991-99y. on the other, at the florence european council in june 1996. the 2 see part b of this chapter: a special focus on technology development. 3 com(96) 109 final of 20 march 1996. see chapter

(1996) 129 a* inter-institutional dialogue the implementation of the structural funds is generating a steady, varied and growing flow of dialogue between the commission and the other community institutions; this dialogue takes many forms, from exchanges of information, now regular and systematic, to the adoption of communications and notices by the commission and opinions and resolutions by the other institutions. the main channels of this dialogue are meetings, both formal (e.g. part-sessions of the european parliament and its committees and ministerial meetings) and informal (seminars or joint working parties), and there is dialogue at both policy-making and technical levels (e.g. between departments and in structural fund committees). this wide range of contacts involves a large number of subjects. in 1996 those chiefly discussed by all the institutions, in response to several commission communications and documents, were employment, economic and social cohesion and the key role of the structural funds. more attention was also devoted to the links between certain policies - the environment, culture, equal opportunities, rural development, fisheries - and the structural funds, action to assist certain types of area (urban, coastal, rural and border) and spatial development at european level. lastly, issues relating to the implementation of structural fund assistance as such remained a central theme, as in previous years, with a specific focus on the progress of programme implementation, the allocation of the community initiative reserve, the preparation of the second phase of the objective 2 programme (1997-99), ways of simplifying the administration and improving the effectiveness and assessment of the structural funds, and how to involve as many players as possible, in particular in the context of territorial pacts for employment. 1. dialogue with the european parliament in 1996 dialogue with parliament covered both the full range of structural policies and specific instances of structural fund assistance. parliament adopted a resolution on economic and monetary union and economic and social cohesion in europe, stating its view that the nominal convergence criteria for transition to a single currency were such as to create a favourable environment for more effective regional policy, a key factor in a long-term cohesion strategy. the resolution also called on the inter-governmental conference to strengthen title xv of the treaty concerning economic and social cohesion. in another resolution on community structural assistance and employment, parliament expressed the view that economic and social cohesion was being undermined by excessively high unemployment rates, in particular in remote regions and those whose development is lagging behind. it called on the commission and the member states to use structural funds resources for measures that would promote long-term job creation. it also asked the commission to develop an evaluation methodology suitable for an improved assessment of the impact of structural policies on employment. there was also intensive discussion of specific cases of structural fund assistance. with regard to regional policy, parliament delivered opinions approving structural fund assistance for objective 1 csfs in portugal, spain, greece and ireland, while stressing the problems requiring particular attention in each case. parliament also gave its views on the guidelines for the second programme of innovative measures under article 10 of the erdf regulation. given the considerable interest attracted by measures under article 10 in the previous financing period and the remarkable results of measures during that period, parliament encouraged the commission to promote inter-regional cooperation measures and pilot projects as widely as possible. in another resolution it approved the policy guidelines which the commission had followed in its allocation of the community initiatives reserve, but expressed its regret that the industrial initiatives had received so little extra funding and that the regis initiative had received no additional appropriations. commission members also frequently addressed parliament. the main focus of commission addresses to the committee on regional policy was employment and cohesion. mrs wulf-mathies, the member of the commission with special responsibility for regional policy and cohesion, outlined the main aspects of the confidence pact for employment proposed by the commission in 1996 and stressed the role of the structural funds in implementing the resulting territorial pacts for 1^0 ^^ 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) employment. she also spoke about the first approaches to be explored concerning the reform of structural policies in preparation for the enlargement of the union to include central and eastern european countries. on other occasions, she summarised the main points of the first report on economic and social cohesion and presented the commission's work programme for 1997. mr oreja, the member of the commission with special responsibility for cultural matters, attended the joint meeting of the committee on regional policy and the committee on culture, where he presented the commission's cultural programme, emphasising the role that the cultural sector could play in generating employment and therefore advocating that community policies should take greater account of it. the commission was also present at the conference organised by parliament and the union's regional and local authorities. in his address to the conference, president santer reminded those present of the importance of the principle of partnership, which meant that regional and municipal authorities were more involved in work towards cohesion. mrs wulf-mathies also focused on the growing importance of the regions in the european project, while mr oreja gave an account of progress made at the inter-governmental conference. the commission continued its discussions of social issues with parliament through the ad hoc working group, which continued the work begun in 1995. at its meetings, the working group examined a variety of esf issues, both horizontal aspects, such as assessment, financial equalisation and relocations, and specific aspects of implementing esf assistance, such as payments, carryovers, budgets and forecasts. the working group proved very useful as a channel for more in-depth dialogue and explanation of esf assistance. its value was demonstrated by the fact that parliament's committee on social affairs decided in september 1996 to increase the number of its members participating in the group to ten. the discussions of parliament's committee on agriculture and rural development culminated in the adoption, on 25 october 1996, of a resolution on european rural policy and on the creation of a european rural charter. parliament stated that in the light of the problems facing rural areas and in order to keep up employment levels in the countryside, it was essential to establish an integrated multi-sectoral policy that would give priority to employment and foster improvements in the quality of agricultural products, the protection of the environment, equal opportunities and the development of services. the committee on agriculture and rural development also addressed the issue of young farmers and the transfer of farms. other matters it discussed were ways of improving existing mechanisms and the distribution of powers and responsibilities between the commission and the member states. *\" the commission maintained regular and fruitful dialogue with parliament's committee on fisheries. several parliamentary questions were addressed to the commission on the subject of structural assistance for fisheries, including measures eligible for fifg financing, the distribution of such financing and the community pesca initiative. mrs bonino, the member of the commission with special responsibility for fisheries, attended several meetings with parliament, both at the committee on fisheries and at plenary sessions. the commission also responded to a parliamentary resolution on the crisis in the fisheries sector which raised several issues about structural assistance for fisheries. finally, parliament endorsed the third and fourth amendments to the fifg regulation1. 2. dialogue with the economic and social committee the commission continued its contacts and cooperation with the economic and social committee at all levels. the committee gave its reactions and comments in opinions which were studied attentively by the commission. the committee considers that economic and social cohesion should be the leitmotif of all regional assistance, and most of its opinions were formulated with this in mind. in its opinion on the future of cohesion and the long-term implications for the structural funds, the committee addressed the full range of cohesion issues and examined the challenges facing the structural funds. it stressed the importance of european regional policy instruments in the context of 1 see chapter i.a.i. objective 5(a) fisheries. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 131 an enlarged union in which economic and monetary union will have become \u00e0 reality. similarly, in its opinion on the sixth annual report on the structural funds (1994), it stressed the importance of economic and social cohesion and job creation, while specifying that the latter must be pursued with a view to long-term economic development and should not constitute the only criterion for granting funding. the committee also reaffirmed the importance of the principles of structural action and urged effective implementation of the principle of partnership. the committee welcomed the consistent nature of the allocation of the community initiative reserve proposed in the commission decision and the fact that more funding was going to the employment initiative; at the same time it underlined the need for monitoring and assessment. it also expressed its support for a policy designed to achiever greater synergy between cohesion and environmental policies and called on the commission to define specific measures for putting the proposed principles into practice. with regard to urban issues, the committee pointed out the value added that differentiated operations integrating social, economic and environmental aspects could contribute towards greater economic and social cohesion. with this in mind, it called for urban issues to become one of the community's responsibilities. spatial planning was also the subject of discussion within the committee in connection with its work on the \"europe 2000+\" planning document, with particular attention devoted to specific problems facing the alpine arc; the committee proposed using the structural funds to help deal with these problems. as regard the integrated development planning of coastal areas, it recommended that the aims of funding to be allocated to this objective should be more thoroughly defined. finally the committee unanimously endorsed the two amendments to the fifg regulation2 (adapting the premium arrangements and concerning reference to the geographical origin of products). 3. relations with the committee of the regions the dialogue between the commission and the committee of the regions was continued and stepped up following the guidelines adopted by the commission in april 1995. at the beginning of the year, the commission sent the committee a projected programme of consultations going beyond those provided for in the treaty. the commission actively participated in the committee's work and regularly informed it of action taken in response to its opinions. the committee particularly focused on employment and the greater role which the structural funds should play in this area. in june 1996 president santer addressed the committee, presenting the confidence pact for employment in europe. he stressed the key role of local and regional authorities in implementing the pact and called on the committee to make an active contribution. for its part, the committee adopted a resolution stating its intention of participating fully in the specific process of implementing territorial pacts for employment. mrs wulf-mathies also participated in the committee's work on two occasions. in january she spoke on the interaction between cohesion and environmental policies, stressing the growing importance of the environmental factor in the competitiveness of regions and the contribution being made by structural and cohesion fund assistance to improving the environment in disadvantaged regions. in november she presented the first report on economic and social cohesion, noting that the effectiveness of structural policies should be increased to deal with the challenges lying ahead, in particular by concentrating assistance, making continuation of programmes conditional on results and improving financial management. the committee also stated its position on subjects such as the new regional programming under objectives 1 and 2, the allocation of the community initiative reserve, the union's policy on cross-border cooperation with the russian federation and the region around the barents sea and regional cooperation in the baltic. the commission organised, jointly with the committee of the regions, a series of six seminars to examine, with the representatives of local and regional authorities and social and economic partners, the role of spatial development in europe as elaborated in the \"europe see chapter i.a.5. objective 5(a) fisheries. 132 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 2000+\" document. the results of these seminars are recorded in a report by the committee of the regions. the committee issued three opinions on rural development. the first called for a rural development policy based on a multi-sectoral approach and aimed at all rural areas, but with programmes defined at regional level to take account of each region's specific characteristics. the second concerned new forms of economic activity and new services in rural areas and recommended that, since services were playing an increasingly important role in the economy and had major job-creation potential, they should be actively fostered in rural areas, their quality and conditions of access should be improved and the use of telecommunication networks in isolated regions should be developed. the third dealt with young farmers and the problems of the transfer of farms. it called for the conditions for young farmers taking over farms to be made easier by developing an early retirement scheme, authorising multiple sources of income, facilitating access to training for young farmers, harmonising taxes and other charges on the sale or inheritance of farms, staggering payments of setting-up costs and improving the provision of information on ways of setting up in farming. in june 1996 mr fischler, the member of the commission with special responsibility for agriculture and rural development, gave a talk on the implications of enlargement for agricultural policy and took the opportunity to give his views on the future of the cap and rural development policy. finally, the committee of the regions gave its opinion on the regional impact of the common fisheries policy, analysing, among other things, the role of the fifg and pesca on the regions. 4. informal meetings of the ministers responsible for regional policy and spatial planning the ministers responsible for regional policy and spatial planning attended two informal meetings in 1996, one on 3 and 4 may in venice under the italian presidency and the other on 14 and 15 november in ballyconnell under the irish presidency. the second meeting was organised in the form of a seminar. the venice meeting discussed the effectiveness and monitoring of the structural funds and how to simplify their application, and culture and regional development. with regard to the implementation of structural measures, the ministers expressed the view that the funds were operating properly but certain improvements were needed in programme quality and implementation, financial management and the application of the principle of partnership. it was agreed that structural fund assistance procedures needed simplifying in order to reduce delays. in this connection, the need was pointed out for the decision-making procedure for the new objective 2 programming and the use of the community initiative reserve to be as simple as possible. the ministers also fully endorsed the objectives of the sem 2000 initiative3. in addition, they recognised the role of culture in regional development and job-creation in the less advantaged regions of the european union. they agreed that it would be desirable to develop structural fund assistance for various types of cultural activities such as the protection and development of the cultural heritage and the improvement of culture-related industries and products4. the meeting devoted to spatial planning constituted an additional stage in the process of elaborating the european spatial development perspective (esdp) begun at the end of 1993. the esdp will be an indicative document proposing a reference framework for spatial development for community policies which involve this dimension (the cap, the structural funds, the environment, major networks, etc.), and the spatial development policies of member states and their regional and local authorities, as well as various cooperative projects in this area. the most recent contributions of member state administrations on this subject were discussed in venice. the analysis of major trends in european spatial development was continued in greater depth. however, the ministers stressed that studies of this type, which were necessary in the initial stages, should be temporarily suspended and 3 see chapter ii.b. checks and financial management. 4 see also chapter ii.d. complementarity with other community policies. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) j33 during the next stage the emphasis should be on defining differentiated policy guidelines adapted to the particular characteristics of different parts of europe. some initial specific suggestions on this subject by the member states were presented in venice. the italian presidency also submitted two studies, one on the future of european cities and the other ways of making more of the cultural heritage. the ministers highlighted the importance that should be accorded to these two subjects in the future esdp. they also reminded the spatial development committee, which is in charge of drawing up the esdp, that they hoped that by the meeting in june 1997 under the dutch presidency they would be able to give their opinions at on a first official outline esdp which could serve as the basis for broad public discussion with the various parties concerned. at the ballyconnell seminar on 14 and 15 november, where spatial planning issues as such were not on the agenda, discussion focused on ways in which structural fund programmes could do more to encourage job creation, on the promotion of territorial employment pacts and on the first report on economic and social cohesion. it was generally agreed that the impact of structural fund programmes on employment should be made a priority in the next mid-term programme reviews. it was agreed that the commission would draw up guidelines for adjusting current objective 1 and 6 programmes, concentrating on the development of employment. there was also emphatic support for the goal of promoting 60 employment pacts under structural funds programmes. in discussing the report on economic and social cohesion, ministers expressed the view that progress towards convergence was being made and that community structural policies had contributed to this progress. they stressed the need to maintain economic competitiveness and reduce economic and social disparities. they also agreed there was a need to continue efforts to improve the transparency and effectiveness of structural policies and to work for greater regional and thematic concentration of financial resources. 5. committee opinions the committee on the development and conversion of regions met four times in 1996. it issued only one official opinion, on the list of areas eligible under objective 2 for the 1997-99 programming period. at the committee's meetings there were many discussions on subjects of a general nature, the commission provided information and exchanges of experience took place. the progress of programming was also discussed on the occasion of a talk by the director-general for regional policy and cohesion, on the presentation of the sixth annual report on the structural funds (1994) and when information was given on the preparation of the new programmes under the interreg ii c initiative and pilot projects in spatial planning (article 10 of the erdf regulation). the commission also informed the member states' representatives about certain aspects of structural fund administration such as its procedures for adopting new programmes, the implementation of interim assessments and irregularities of which it had been informed in the context of anti-fraud operations. it also presented communications it had adopted and initiatives it had taken concerning links with other community policies (environment, employment and innovation). finally, as pan of the sem 2000 exercise, each committee meeting addressed the question of the eligibility of expenditure under the structural funds. when it had presented its guidelines on this subject, the commission consulted the committee, and all the other structural fund committees, for an initial examination of the eligibility criteria. the result was a consensus on the need for clear and transparent rules adopted in partnership between the commission and the member states. in parallel with the work of the group of personal representatives of finance ministers and pursuant to council guidelines, a draft commission decision was presented to the committees at the end of 1996, to be adopted at the beginning of 1997. the esf committee also met four times in 1996. following long discussions, the committee created an ad hoc working group on the contribution of the esf to growth with a higher job-creation factor in the context of existing measures to fight unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. the group met six times in 1996 and presented its interim report to the committee in september. as laid down by the coordination regulation, the committee issued its opinion on draft commission decisions on csfs and spds under objectives 2, 3 and 4 for the 1997-99 programming period. the commission also informed the committee about the implementation of innovative measures under 134 \u0142 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) article 6 of the esf regulation. other subjects studied by the committee were equal opportunities, the green paper on innovation, the commission's interim report on objective 4 and the adapt initiative, the implementation of the peace initiative, the annual report of the court of auditors, and fraud-related irregularities reported by the member states. finally, at its last meeting in 1996, the committee adopted its work programme for 1997. the committee on agricultural structures and rural development (the star committee) met 11 times in 1996 and issued 155 favourable opinions. these concerned principally measures under regulations (eec) nos 2328/91 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures, 2078/92 on agricultural production methods compatible with the requirements of the protection of the environment and the maintenance of the countryside and 866/90 on improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural products. it issued favourable opinions on all the swedish spds under objective 5(b). the committee also discussed other subjects such as compensatory payments, additionally and assessment. the management committee on fisheries structures met five times in 1996 and was informed of all structural operations relating to this sector. the management committee for community initiatives met twice in 1996 and endorsed the allocation of the financial reserve and the new guidelines for certain initiatives. the committee held a initial policy debate at the end of 1995 which enabled the commission, after consultation with the member states and parliament, to present a paper taking account of the comments made. committee meetings also included exchanges of information and experience on trans-national cooperation under community initiatives, progress in implementing the initiatives and the preparation of the interreg iic programmes. b. regional partnership following commission approval, after consultation with each member state, of the programming documents, 1995 was devoted to the gradual establishment of the new partnership arrangements. the seventh annual report (1995) gave a first account of these activities, broken down by member state and the different partners concerned. during 1996 the partners consolidated and progressively improved their practice. application of the principle was complex and sometimes difficult, but one year is not long enough to assess significant advances at community level. the commission's work to further application of the partnership principle had three main strands in 1996: consideration in greater depth of ways in which partnership might be reinforced, as proposed in the previous report; promoting experimentation with complementary approaches, already recorded in the implementation of certain programmes; and increasing the capacity of certain partners, continuing to endorse the approaches arrived at during the annual consultation on 1995 structural assistance. 1. consideration and promotion of new forms of partnership a discussion paper was drawn up for the members of the 'cohesion' group of the commission; it noted that despite a positive balance overall, partnership remained imperfect in a number of cases and there was therefore room for improvement. it posed a number of questions about how to overcome difficulties in implementing the partnership and proposed specific guidelines for improvement while avoiding the pitfalls of either multiplying partnerships to an extent that defeats the purpose of the exercise or reducing participation in the partnership to that of national and regional authorities and commission staff. the proposals were aimed in particular at: \u0142 encouraging an immediate start to discussions in preparation for the period after 1999 on reformulating the legal framework to allow improved implementation of the partnership, in particular by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of each partner; \u0142 reinforcing the current partnership within the monitoring committees by establishing, if necessary and politically acceptable, a differentiation between partners part-financing assistance (\"decision 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 135 v partnership\") and partners who are consulted (\"consultative partnership\") or by exploring other forms of consultation, coordination and cooperation; \u0142 improving the technical and operational capacities of partners where necessary by supporting training, information and technical assistance measures. more generally, the paper proposes promoting exemplary and innovative initiatives at community level in cooperation with national and/or regional authorities. such initiatives would include territorial pacts for employment or partnerships for employment that foster a dynamic policy at the appropriate regional or local level and are intended to enrich the activities of the monitoring committees and bring together those involved in job creation in informal meetings where discussions can be held and proposals put forward. these proposals were contained in the commission communication on community structural assistance and employment5 and consolidated in its communication \"action for employment in europe - a confidence pact\". to take advantage of the existing room for manoeuvre, the commission specified the main priorities to be implemented and proposed establishing territorial employment pacts to mobilise the public and private sectors at the appropriate regional, national or local level. it stressed that, without actually creating new structures, a political momentum needed to be launched and promoted, either by a systematic approach initiated by the national authority concerned and applied throughout the region or area concerned, or by experimental approaches based on each member state selecting the areas or regions it judged most appropriate, or, again, at the initiative of local authorities themselves. the florence european council (june 1996) subsequently called on each member state to select, where possible, regions or towns suitable for participating in pilot projects concerning employment pacts so that such pacts could be implemented during 1997, partly by using the margins available under the structural polices. technical documents were drafted and presented to the national authorities, in particular during an information meeting in november. the dublin european council (december 1996) welcomed the positive reactions to the initiatives concerning the territorial pacts for employment and called for the rapid implementation of the 60 projects proposed by the member states. the commission helped the member states to implement this strategy by drafting guidelines for the pacts: \u0142 the range of partners should be as wide as possible and include national, regional and local authorities, the private sector, associations for the development or conversion of the area concerned, the socio-economic partners, representatives of citizens' cooperatives and associations, trade and professional organisations and chambers of commerce, institutions providing training, promoting technology or carrying out research and the chairpersons of the monitoring committees for structural assistance; \u0142 each pact should produce a document giving an account of analyses carried out, the precise commitments of each participant and specific proposals adopted. the proposals may take different forms: measures that promote job creation; measures to assist specific sections of the population; proposals concerning social and labour law; suggestions to the socio-economic partners about working organisation and working hours; support for innovative or experimental pilot projects; improving education and training; improving the operational and administrative capacity of regional or local authorities and specific proposals addressed to the structural policy monitoring committees as to how to use available margins and more effectively direct structural assistance towards job creation. 5 com(96) 109 of 20 march 1996. see introduction and chapter ii.d. complementarity with other community policies. 136 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) leader and the bottom-up approach. -. one of the fundamental aims of leader is to mobilise as broad a local partnership as possible. it has been found mat the greater the involvement of local people, the greater the effort to find solutions appropriate to the specific problems of each area concerned. the most innovative leader groups with the greatest chance of success are those which involve representatives of all the local socio-economic groups. the leader european observatory, in collaboration with the leader \"alia val venosta\" group, organised a seminar in trentino alto adige in october 1996 on the subject of \"partnership for innovation\". the construction, results and timespan of die partnership were discussed. this local action group (lag) was selected as an example of the creation of a culture of partnership in an area not traditionally propitious to this approach. the provincial authorities showed a particular interest in this project and provided substantial assistance. there are four levels to the partnership: a prefinancing partnership (province, state, commission); a partnership responsible for administration and the programme (inter-municipal association); the lag; five informal working parties (agriculture, tourism, crafts, training and data transmission). specific training programmes have been developed for each project following the success of the val venosta seminar, the austrian leader network organised a meeting on the same subject in schlierbach in december 1996. a study group for structural renewal was formed mere made up of a number of concentric circles: the four founders, members of the association (about 20 people) and all the local actors from the different sectors involved (agriculture, alternative energy sources, education, business, etc.). this group stimulated new forms of cooperation and partnership. the association played a key role in forming the lag of which it is one of the members. since die area of eisenwurzen is relatively well developed, the local actors focused on development projects to improve the quality of life and preserve the natural and cultural heritage. in a different context, on the left bank of the guadiana in the south-east alentejo, a region lagging behind in development, with high unemployment, suffering from rural depopulation and with a traditional, not very structured society, an association was established in 1992 at the initiative of private individuals. the association gradually become a permanent forum for local development, bringing together municipalities and organisations involved in the development of the area. in response to the difficulties encountered under leader i, the association included as many players as possible to create a permanent forum and a large number of working parties, trying in this way to involve local people, including those most marginalised. 2. increasing the partners' capacities under article 7 of the erdf regulation, the commission contributes to measures to improve partners' capacity to participate actively in the monitoring of structural assistance. in this context, funding was allocated to the council of european municipalities and regions (cemr) to organise seminars on the participation of local authorities in preparing and implementing structural assistance in objective 2 areas. a total of nine seminars were held in various member states, with a final session in brussels to review the results. this enabled the commission to explain more fully its own guidelines for the new objective 2 programming period, to become better acquainted with the practical operation of partnership at local level and to facilitate the systematic submission of proposals by local authorities concerning their participation in structural assistance. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 137 3. opinions of the other institutions on the application of the partnership principle at the joint conference which they organised in 19966, parliament and the committee of the regions approved a final declaration which: \u0142 states their belief that \"it is necessary to redefine the principle of subsidiarity to make explicit provision for its application to regional and local authorities in accordance with the powers vested in them by the domestic law of the member states, with a view to achieving greater efficiency [-]\"; \u0142 calls for \"the principle of local autonomy as defined in the council of europe's charter of local self-govemment to be incorporated in the treaty as a general principle of community law derived from the shared constitutional traditions of the member states\" and states that this principle \"entails both respect for all the powers proper to the local authorities and the granting of the means necessary for their exercise\", also calling for \"due recognition of the principle of regional autonomy by analogy with its equivalent at local level\"; \u0142 calls on the commission and the member states to ensure \"a better horizontal and vertical coordination of eu policies to [...] limit the disadvantages to regions and local authorities [...]\"; \u0142 calls for \"the principle of partnership, which has been tried and tested in the implementation of the community's structural policies and which constitutes a practical expression of the subsidiarity principle, to be more fully applied and strengthened by incorporating it in the ec treaty and extending it to other policies, particularly those for which regional and local authorities are responsible\" and recommends that \"the member states extend this principle to the social partners\"; \u0142 expresses the view that when the structural funds are next reformed, \"they should be consolidated as instruments of economic development, with the following priorities [among others]: simplification, reduced bureaucracy and greater flexibility of procedures; more direct partnership with regional, local and social partners, particularly in the context of .programming\". c. dialogue with the economic and social partners 1. the socio-economic partnership in the implementation and monitoring of structural assistance the participation of the economic and social partners in structural assistance follows the rules laid down in article 4 of the framework regulation, which specify that member states should designate the economic and social partners at national, regional, local or other level following the rules and practices of the institutions concerned in each member state. consequently the composition and operation of the partnerships varies considerably from country to country according to the national cultural and political traditions, as well as varying from one objective to another within the same country. the seventh annual report (1995) presented the information available to the commission about each member state as regards the partners' participation in preparing and coordinating assistance for the new programming period, 1994-99, and their involvement in the work of the corresponding monitoring committees. 1996 was a year in which rules and practices introduced for the new programming period were consolidated. since the monitoring committees were set up in 1994 and 1995, the composition of the partnership within these bodies has stabilised. for example, the social partners are generally now represented on the monitoring committees for measures under objectives 3 and 4, except in portugal and the united kingdom. in the latter case, representation is slowly being introduced for the regional objectives, but is still not allowed for objective 3. in italy, the participation of the social partners in objectives 3 and 4 has been established, but is applied to the regional objectives to varying degrees. the participation of representatives to promote equal opportunities has been vigorously encouraged in italy. they are full members of decision-making bodies in all the member states except germany, ' \"the european parliament and the regional and local authorities of the european union for a europe based on democracy and solidarity\", brussels, 1-3 october 1996. 14 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) commission proposed promoting territorial pacts for employment to complement existing national policies. at the invitation of the european council, the pilot regions were selected by the member states. that approach was confirmed by the dublin european council, which called for the swift implementation of 60 pilot projects with the aim of promoting broad regional or local partnerships demonstrating an exceptional level of mobilisation for employment. following assessment of the difficulties and prospects by each of the local parties concerned, a joint strategy based on that assessment is devised and given form in commitments by all those involved in a territorial employment pact, with the aim of improving the integration and coordination of measures for employment and, over time, carrying out model operations which can inspire other initiatives. an employment pact may be promoted at regional or local level, in cities, rural areas or employment areas, provided that unemployment is a major problem and the region is eligible under one of the objectives of the structural funds. the range of partners should be as wide as possible6. as regards the schedule and financing, the reflection phase began at the end of 1996 and the member states are expected to make the final selection of pact areas in 1997. the pacts can be financed in part by contributions from the eib and the eif, and the monitoring committees for the structural fund programmes should use the financial margins for manoeuvre available7 to implement them. the commission contributes to implementation of the pacts in three ways: by supporting these initiatives and circulating the experience gained from them; by providing financial support for preparatory technical assistance work and by organising a mechanism to monitor all the preparatory work, the final content, and the improvements made to structural assistance. 3. the implementation of assistance in 1996 : the main points in this report a very busy year the implementation of multiannual programming in 1996 shows-that the various forms of assistance are now being put into effect in the member states and the regions8. the objectives of the structural funds are being implemented through almost 500 individual operations; of these only 50 for all the objectives taken together, representing less than 3% of total assistance under all the objectives, were additional to the programmes already adopted in 1994 et 1995. the objective 2 programmes adopted in 1994 for 1994-96 were wound up and there was active preparation concerning the areas eligible and the main thrust of those to continue them in 1997-99. during the preparation of these programmes, the plans for which were presented and discussed in the second half of the year, the commission set several priorities for assistance, all of which are concerned with job creation. turning to the community initiatives, the new programme decisions (123, accounting for 17% of funding under the community initiatives, including the reserve) meant that almost all the initiatives have been translated into operational programmes, half of them in their entirety; 1996 was the year when all the initiatives began to function. the financial reserve of ecu 1 665 million (at 1995 prices) was allocated by the commission on the basis of a number of priorities - combating unemployment, equal opportunities and combating exclusion, the environment and the territorial dimension of structural policies. these led to the creation of new strands: employment \"integra\" (combating exclusion), adapt \"bis\" (adaptation to the information society), interreg ii c (trans-national cooperation on spatial development planning). in 1996 the pilot projects became active after a year's delay: following successful calls for proposals, selection by the commission was followed by the start of work on the ground during the year. this meant that 1996 was a busy year in the 1994-99 progiamming cycle, the second year of effective implementation since most of the programmes had been adopted at the end of 1994, or in 1995 6 see chapter iii.b. regional partnership. 7 these are the resources made available by the indexing of amounts of finance, either from the new objective 2 programmes established for 1997-99, or from the adjustment of programmes under objectives other than objective 2 following the mid-term review. 8 see chapter i. the implementation of assistance. 138 . 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) where they do not participate, but if one considers the degree to which they actually make use of this right, the situation is less homogeneous. the social partners have a certain influence in austria, denmark and finland, related to the strong tradition of social dialogue in those countries. in the netherlands they play a very important role because of their experience of debate on the ground (they are often the channel for signs of malfunction, in particular as regards objective 4, since they are involved in training for workers). in belgium and fiance, although their contribution is sometimes very constructive, it is generally on a fairly small scale and varies according to the programmes and representatives concerned. however, the participation of the economic and social partners is not restricted to the monitoring committees, and it is strongly influenced by social and political structures, practices and traditions in each member state. they are consulted by governments and often participate in defining employment and training policy part-financed by the esf at national, local or regional level. despite certain improvements (for example, in france, members of regional joint cornmittees for employment and training), their participation at local level in the implementation of esf operations still needs to be stepped up. several innovative measures have been encouraged by the commission, on occasion at the initiative of the social partners themselves (finland), to organise operations to inform and train the social partners, since their involvement and influence depends on their having learnt how the esf operates (in finland an intensive training programme was drawn up jointly by employers and employees and seminars were organised; in italy the unions organised training and studies on the role of the unions in the administration of the esf; in france, agreements were concluded between the unions and the ministry concerned on the training of advisors for inter-branch networks). the situation as regards objective 4 is more satisfactory in this respect, since the social partners aie normally very involved in most of the member states, where they continue their traditional forms of participation but are also more and more involved in promoting, devising and implementing projects. this is the case in denmark (for the other objectives too), finland (where a project for restructuring the graphic design industries has been launched by the two trade federations concerned), france (emergence of collective operations between the national authorities and the economic and social partners with a view to initiating projects in small and medium-sized business and industry to improve quality and management, the environment and health and safety; establishment of a body collecting funds for training and also responsible for a multi-media training project in the food industry). their involvement in this objective sometimes even includes participation in programme management and the appointment of representatives of the social partners to promote objective 4 in smes and assist them with implementation, as has been the case in die netherlands. it is very important for the quality of implementation of the structural funds to develop the active participation of the social partners both at local level and in projects, to provide the partners directly with information and training about the structural funds and to improve the match between the type of programmes and/or projects and the selection of partners and operational procedures. all these aspects therefore need to be further developed. 2. the economic and social partners at community level encouraging participation commission operations to promote the participation of the social and economic partners are focused around three types of activity, already referred to in the context of regional partnership7: discussion, promotion and equipping them better for participation. all the analyses, discussions and proposals contained in the relevant commission communications, the report on economic and social cohesion and the conclusions of the european councils of florence and dublin cited above with reference to regional partnership apply equally to the economic and social partners. in terms of specific action to encourage participation, all the efforts to mobilise those involved, broaden the partnership and create 7 see b. above, regional partnership. sth annual report on the structural funds (1996) 139 informal forums for participation were equally directed at the economic and social partners. similarly the initiative to promote territorial employment pacts is intended to facilitate the practical participation of the economic and social partners in improving the programming of structural assistance to increase its impact on employment. to better equip the social and economic partners for participation, an erdf technical assistance operation for the european trade union confederation (etuc) was adopted on the basis of the conclusions of the annual consultation of 1 february 1996. during the consultation it transpired that the social partners do not yet have the necessary technical capacity to monitor structural assistance. they are not always able to prepare specific proposals to improve the effectiveness of their partnership at national and regional level. the community subsidy to the etuc is to be used to hold various seminars and support a small network of experts. the seminars should enable the union leaders concerned better to understand and monitor structural assistance in objective i and 2 areas and the most remote regions. other seminars will concern horizontal assistance and inter-regional measures, and their content will be decided in collaboration with commission staff in the light of the most important developments in the sphere of structural policies. the commission will assist the etuc in organising a small community network of experts on regional development to facilitate the organisation of seminars, ensure the effective and efficient participation of the union leaders concerned and officially document the conclusions and proposals arrived at. in principle, the network will be made up of six half-time experts supported by other independent experts and headed by a coordinator who will organise several meetings to exchange information and discuss working methods. as regards the esf, following the pattern of previous years commission relations with the three major pan-union organisations (etuc, unice and ceep) in 1996 took the form of part-financing training operations in the context of the social dialogue, with particular emphasis on the issue of industrial change. these operations are to be seen as tools for enhancing social dialogue in order to deal better with the impact of industrial and technological change on industrial relations. they allow structural assistance under objective 4 and the community adapt initiative, which encourage the active participation of the social partners in their implementation, to be more effective. in the case of the etuc, the operations part-financed consisted of 18 training courses in which trade union organisations from the fifteen member states participated. the courses dealt with the impact of new technology on employment in areas such as the pharmaceutical industry, catering, mail-order trade and the textile and clothing industry as well as new methods of organising work in similar branches. training sessions were also organised under the conpri ii project8 under the auspices of unice, as an extension of the conpri programme. the seminars had three objectives: dealing with the changes brought about by industrial change in a manner both economically efficient and socially acceptable, contributing to training policies appropriate to the modernisation of production structures and improving competitiveness and industrial relations through the implementation of policies on with the human, logistical and organisational factors. the programme of operations presented by the ceep. called eurexcter is designed to promote regional and local excellence in europe and integrate an emphasis on quality into the social dialogue at regional and local levels. in 1996 the esf also continued to finance sectoral studies in partnership with the social partners concerned on the effect of industrial change on the world of work (qualifications, new skills and new trades in particular) in the footwear, clothing and civil aviation industries among others. consultation of the economic and social partners at european level this consultation is organised on a sectoral basis as well as being a forum for the representation of all social partner organisations at european level. on rural matters the advisory committee on questions of agricultural structure policy is the forum for consultation with the socio-economic partners at community level. it met three times in 1996 and gave its opinion on the application of certain measures. the committee held a wide-ranging debate on the three accompanying measures to the confederations of employers for industrial relations. 140 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) reform of the cap (regulations (eec) nos 2078/92, 2079/92 and 2080/92). it also gave its view on the commission's report to the council on young farmers and stressed the importance of the assistance provided, the difficulties involved in taking over farms and the need for information and training. with regard to regulation (eec) no 2328/91 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures, various opinions were delivered on the status of those for whom farming is the main source of income, hill farming, the possibility of making the reference income more flexible and assistance for small farms. in the context of regulation (eec) no 866/90 on improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural products, discussion focused on the opening up of new sectors, taking account of the specific characteristics of different regions, the level of national aid and adjustment of the selection criteria. the committee was also kept regularly informed about the preparatory work for the european conference on rural development, to which the social and economic partners were invited. the advisory committee on fisheries is the official body for dialogue with those working in the fisheries sector. on several occasions it received information and explanations about the implementation of the fifg, innovative measures under article 4 of the fifg regulation9 and the community pesca initiative. commission staff also participated in the work of the joint committee on social problems in maritime fisheries, established as part of the social dialogue. the commission also consults annually all the social partners organised at european level as laid down by the coordination regulation of the structural funds (article 31(2)). this consultation took place on 18 december 1996. approximately thirty representatives of such organisations took part in the meeting, which mrs wulf-mathies also attended. the main subjects discussed, by agreement with the social partners, were the seventh annual report on the structural funds (1995), the first report on e. gnomic and social cohesion, work in progress and the prospects for the future. all the partners warmly welcomed the commission's work on the cohesion report. they wished to see discussion of the analyses and questions raised by the report continued. most partners stressed the importance of cohesion in the building of the community and the need to find ways of making competitiveness compatible with the objectives of cohesion policy; they also recognised the difficulty of accurately assessing the impact of cohesion policy on other community and national policies. certain partners emphasised: \u0142 the need to improve convergence between the union's social policies and those of the member states; \u0142 the role the single market should play, despite certain continuing blockages, in increasing the competitiveness of the european economy and economic and social cohesion; \u0142 the value of carrying out specific studies to identify better the causes of regional disparities; \u0142 the need to protect the european social model; \u0142 the value of improving analysis of the causes of unemployment and making more specific proposals to combat them; \u0142 the need for a better forecast of the impact that economic and monetary union may have on regional imbalances and disparities; \u0142 the value of a policy geared to specific local and regional characteristics to help create a level playing field between regions; \u0142 problems affecting specific sectors such as fisheries and specific policies such as the cap. with regard to the content and orientation of future structural policies, all the partners stressed the need for a greater concentration of assistance and better targeting of objectives and eligible areas. certain partners also made more specific points concerning: \u0142 seeking greater coherence between structural assistance and community and national policies for employment in order to build on the guidelines of the essen european council, in particular support for active labour market policies; 9 see chapter i.c.2. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 141 \u0142 the fact that current aid must not be considered as an automatic right by the beneficiaries, although changes in the allocation of aid should not be too abrupt or harsh; \u0142 giving greater attention to job creation, in particular by developing new sources of employment, local development and support for sectors sheltered from competition; \u0142 the attention to be paid, in employment matters, to the issues of the environment, equal opportunities and the information society; \u0142 the need to involve private firms more fully in structural assistance; \u0142 a better balance between grants and loans by adapting instruments to the needs of small firms; \u0142 programming structural assistance by sector rather than by geographical area; \u0142 the role of economic services of general interest and the quality of their input in programming future assistance; \u0142 specific problems in the fisheries sector. as regards the operational side of structural assistance, all the partners agreed with the analysis of the cohesion report, namely that there is a need to simplify assistance procedures, reduce the number of programmes and community initiatives, improve the effectiveness of management systems, raise the profile of assistance and step up measures to combat fraud. the partners considered that the complexity of the present forms of operation limits their ability to participate actively in preparing and implementing assistance. they continued to ask to be more fully involved in both the planning and actual implementation of assistance and given more genuine responsibilities. finally, all the partners expressed support for the work in progress on and prospects for the employment pacts initiative, qualifying their approval with the following points: if the partnership is opened to too many partners, this may limit its effectiveness; the social partners should be more involved in the process of area selection and in the preparation and implementation of the pacts; innovative projects allowing a greater degree of partnership work, in particular through public/private cooperation, should be sought. the consultation showed that: \u0142 all the partners appreciate the commission's efforts in proposing guidelines better adapted to the problems of cohesion, development and employment; \u0142 the commission's analyses and proposals were on the whole well-received; \u0142 there was a certain weakness in the partners' contributions, probably because their limited resources, the diversity of community initiatives and the multiplicity of forums for dialogue and consultation on these subjects (social dialogue committee, standing committee on employment, esf committee, the annual consultation, etc.). this confirms the need for community technical assistance for the partners; \u0142 there has been gradual progress in the partnership, although further progress remains to be made. at community level, a better balance still needs to be found between the plenary session of the annual consultation and activities of the preliminary informal working party and/or bilateral contacts. d. information am) communication, spreading good practice 1. information and communication the member states have obligations concerning information and communication about operations financed by the structural funds, which are specified in article 32 of regulation (eec) no 4253/88 and the implementing decision adopted by the commission on 31 may 199410. pursuant to this decision, the commission provided the relevant authorities in the member states with a practical guide. in this sphere 1996 was devoted principally to a first inventory of operations undertaken by member states, which should lead to an exchange of experiences on better practices in this field. the 10 commission decision concerning information and publicity measures to be carried out by the member states concerning assistance from the structural funds and the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (fifg) -ojnol 152, 18.6.1994. 142 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) second meeting of the member state representatives responsible for esf information was held in brussels in june 1996. member states reports on the implementation of article 32 were presented. considerable progress has been made in this field, although the situation is still very uneven among member states. a third meeting of this informal network is planned for 1997. in the sphere of regional operations, under article 7 of the erdf regulation the commission part-financed major events, the organisation of seminars and other individual operations. for example, it was represented by an information stand at 37 events, of which it initiated half and which were attended by more than 30 000 representatives of the political, academic and institutional worlds. the commission made contributions through speakers, the organisation of assistance and documentation (more than 60 000 copies of various publications, plus 1 200 press releases and more than 300 press articles). pilot projects aiming to develop better contacts with the media in great britain, france, germany and spain were also extended and the commission provided detailed information, interviews and answers to 148 newspapers. the provision of rapid responses to questions from the press was extended and improved. to inform the general public, for the first time a brochure was published on projects carried out between 1989 and 1993. it was called history of the regions and gave an account of 36 projects selected from the 1 000 listed with the assistance of the member states. other publications included information sheets on financing for regions eligible under objective 2 and two brochures on the environment and cohesion and women, players in regional development. to take better advantage of the opportunities offered by the electronic distribution of documents, the commission also produced pages on the erdf on its internet server (europa), including a database on operational programmes and invitations for proposals published in 1996 for operations financed under article 10 of the erdf regulation. in 1996 the commission plans to make this information available in the languages of the countries concerned. a photo library programme was extended to germany and france, and its extension to italy is being planned. this enterprise puts into practice the new principle of giving priority to publishing, on paper and in databases, examples of the many successful projects part-financed by the structural funds. in the case of the esf, a communications audit was carried out on those responsible for its implementation. this made it possible to evaluate the fund's image, the information available, the tools used and the flow of communication between the different parties involved. as a follow-up, a set of measures were taken to facilitate comprehension of the esf and raise its profile. in parallel with the audit, several new communications aids were launched in 1996. they included publications such as an information magazine on the esf, 15 brochures designed for the general public on the esf in each member state, publications on the adapt and employment community initiatives, the information society (green paper on \"living and working in the information society\", and a brochure entitled \"building the information society for us all in europe\") other measures taken to improve communications were the establishment of an esf site on the europa server, and raising the esf profile at public events (creation of a portable stand and exhibition material). as to the events themselves, a conference was held in toulouse at the beginning of the year to mark the launch of objective 4 projects, and the esf took part in several events on new sources of employment (rome, dublin), the information society (dublin), exchanges of experience among trainees benefiting from esf aid (herbeumont) and the exchange of know-how (madeira). the commission intends to step up its activity in the sphere of rural development policy and has devised a strategy for publicising its activities better. for this purpose it will be using the services of an outside company, and an invitation to tender has been published. during 1996 the commission organised the cork conference, a broad debate on rural development policy. it was held from 7 to 9 november and was extremely successful, with 500 participants engaging in very animated debates on the future of the countryside. information was distributed principally through the european rural development network. the commission has given the european association for information on local development (eaild) the task of running the european rural development network. one of the essential tasks involved is issuing publications. thus the eaild publishes an information bulletin called info-leader about the network (10 issues a year in 7 languages) and leader magazine (3 issues 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 143 in 1996) publicising the results achieved under leader and addressing the key rural development issues being debated in europe; other publications include methodological guides and other technical papers on innovation measures, guides to community operations and rural development, innovative measures for regional development and national and regional leader programmes. most of the information is also available on the commission internet site. an internet site called \"rural europe\" has been-set up with information in six languages, which allows exchanges between those involved in the rural world and participation in forums. in the fisheries sector, several communications measures have been implemented, directed at both those working in the sector and the general public. 15 brochures were published and distributed on european union aid to the development of the fishing industry (one per member state). they summarise all the fifg operations carried out in each member state. the brochure on \"the european community and the fishing industry - practical guide to structural aid\" and information pamphlets on \"the common fisheries policy\" were produced and up-dated and translated into two new languages (swedish and finish). an information bulletin on the trans-national operations of pesca11 (pesca-info) has been published since december 1996. this information sheet, published in all the community languages, covers the pesca community initiative, areas dependent on fisheries and issues affecting the sector in general. in the same context, inter-regional meetings and conferences on particular subjects between public authorities, experts and those working in the sector were started up in december 1996 (the.first, on training, was held at glyngore, denmark), with the aim of improving communication and increasing exchanges of experience between different countries and regions. the positions adopted at the round table on the conversion of areas dependent on fisheries (organised by the commission in 1995) were also published and distributed. several publications can also be consulted on the europa server. 2. spreading 2ood practice and exchanges of experience measures to promote good practice and exchanges of experience were also stepped up considerably in 1996, principally because all the types of structural fund assistance became fully operational, so that initial experience of the implementation of assistance had been acquired. many operations were also carried out under certain objectives, as well as under community initiatives, pilot projects and innovative measures. firstly, one of the aims of the community initiatives is to promote cross-border exchanges, and in 1996 the commission implemented several operations for the present programming period to promote such exchanges12. several initiatives are based on networking to facilitate the exchange of experience between regions and those participating in the programmes. this applies to leader in particular, for which the european observatory for innovation and rural development organises a number of transnational seminars each year on the local approach to rural development. for instance, seminars were organised in sierra de g\u00e2ta (spain) to analyse local tourist potential, in marina di ascea (italy) on the environment, in v\u00e0xj\u00f4 (sweden) on new services for the public, in bad-windsheim (germany) on the situation and prospects for rural europe, in alta val venosta (italy) on partnership for innovation and in languedoc-roussillon (france) on communication and local identity. other seminars provided an opportunity to learn from the first programming.period or to prepare work for the current period through exchanges of information about implementation in bolzano (italy), netze band (bavaria), county kerry (ireland), santar\u00e9m (portugal), dumfries (scodand), and forcalquier (france)). secondly, publicising experience of programmes under specific objectives (csfs/spds) was stepped up considerably. in the case of the ftfg, the publications referred to in the previous chapter, such as european union aid to the development of the fishing industry and pesca-info, often include examples of good practice. similarly, a series of events to promote and publicise practices relevant to esf assistance was held in 1996. in each member state, the commission strongly encouraged 11 see chapter i.b.i community initiatives. 12 see chapter i.b.i community initiatives. 144 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) exchanges of experience through the monitoring committees. at these meetings one or more projects are now presented, by their promoters themselves or by the authority in charge of administering the project, and these accounts give rise to discussion of ideas and practices and future contacts between the various players. furthermore, commission publications on the esf give accounts of projects and thus contribute to the spread of good practice13. such exchanges of information on good practice were also developed among member states. they are an important factor in improving mutual comprehension and cohesion, as well as a valuable basis for future trans-national operations. esf and exchanges <of experience. the following are examples of some events which took place in 1996: \u0142 a forum to foster participation by the beneficiaries of esf operations (herbeumont, june 1996). this exercise in citizenship was aimed mainly at those concerned by objective 3 (job-seekers, the unemployed, recipients of social security). at the forum there were many exchanges between belgian and other community policy-makers, the social and economic partners, institutional and private promoters, social workers, etc.; \u0142 \u00e0 seminar on \"a new structural funds objective: employment and industrial change\" (toulouse, january 1996). this seminar was intended to allow policymakers,, programme managers, social partners and those implementing projects to meet, gain a fuller picture of the economic and social issues involved in industrial change and examine their experiences in implementing objective 4; \u0142 a training seminar for esf managers in the french in the french overseas departments and territories was extended to the other most remote regions (the azores, madeira and the canary islands) in june 1996. the purpose was to publicise what had been achieved in each region and promote contacts for later cooperative operations. the discussions focused on trans-national cooperation as a way of overcoming isolation, new information technologies and social exclusion and integration. cooperation projects between regions resulted from these meetings and contacts were made which led to the participation of those responsible for programmes or projects in madeira participating in the r\u00e9union monitoring committee. \u0142 a seminar on the esf and new sources of employment (italy, june 1996). in this case the main subjects of the presentation and discussion were the quality of life and die environment, protection of die environment, the cultural heritage and local services. the commission presented an account of the initiatives being taken in the member states, in particular using esf assistance. the most practical application of the spread of good practice and the transfer of experience is taking place in the context of pilot projects since, during 1996, several pilot projects financed under article 10 of the erdf regulation were finalised14. these are \"regional technological plans\" (rtps), which have focused the attention of thousands of participants in the first four regions concerned: wales (uk), limburg (netherlands), lorraine (france) and saxony-anhalt (germany). the completion of these four projects allowed the commission to publish the first results of this type of exercise which involves the formulation of a regional strategy for supporting innovation in smes, based on an advance analysis of the needs of regional enterprises. their approach attaches great importance to active consultation of and participation by business people and service suppliers (universities, technology transfer centres, business innovation centres, etc.) in formulating action plans and the new instruments or projects to which they give rise. these regional technological plans have had considerable direct impact on regional operational programmes, as may be seen from the introduction of new instruments or sub-programmes concerning innovation. 13 for example: \"esf measures for the long-term unemployed: a guide to good practice\" in the united kingdom; various publications on objectives 3 and 4 in sweden presenting interesting projects and giving the names and addresses of those running mem. 14 for all the pilot schemes carried out under article 10 of the erdf regulation, see chapter i.b .2., innovative measures and technical assistance. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 145 the experience acquired and good practice learnt from these first projects were also used for the selection and launching during the second half of 1996 of 19 new similar projects, renamed \"regional innovation strategies (ris). to disseminate the results, the commission took several steps in partnership with the regions concerned. firstly, the regions participating in the projects constitute a network whose activities essentially concern the exchange of information on best practices regarding the analysis of regional innovation potential and training methodologies, arrived at by regional consensus on the subject of promoting innovation. secondly, a conference was organised by the region of saxony-anhalt with the commission's support in april 1996 on the subject of promoting innovation and the information society in structural fund programmes. the talks given at this conference were based on the experience acquired of rtps, \"regional information society initiatives\" (risis) - pilot projects launched during the 1994-96 period - and instances of best practice in projects financed by the structural funds in regions of germany, france and the united kingdom, so as to increase the innovation and information society-related content of their new spds under objective 2. lastly, a meeting to launch new ris and ri'i'i's projects was held in luxembourg in september. the meeting was attended by more than 100 representatives of the regions involved in ris/ritts during 1997-98, and was intended to facilitate effective start-up based on the experience of the first pilot projects. the euro-tradelink project: developing electronic trade methods through the exchange of experience in 1996 the commission launched the euro-tradelink project in which irish, italian and spanish smes participated under the direction ofemtel (ireland), the aim being is to develop cross-frontier electronic trade in consumer goods. the project is based on. the transfer of the experience of \"irish tradelink\" to other smes in italian and spanish regions to enable them to establish connections with each other and with other companies. this inter-regional cooperation is thus both a means and an end of the project, whose total cost is ecu 2.9 million, with a community contribution of ecu 1 million. it is being developed in three phases: 1. a feasibility study and recruitment of trade partners. the purpose is to identify and recruit at least twelve trade partners to participate in phase 2. these should be equally distributed among the three countries, with preference given to smes located in objective 1 regions. this phase was completed in 1996; 2. experimental application of a service in the target regions. at this stage, the projects will be finalised to confirm the user community and the operational procedures. this will involve the approval of operational standards and procedures, the preparation of operating specifications, the identification and planning of the level of services provided for each enterprise, applications for documentation, training users, promotional activities and accompanying measures; 3. extending the network to all the enterprises registered in the feasibility phase of the project, i.e. to more than 100 smes in the three member states concerned 4^=t chapter iv evaluation 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 15 (particularly in the case of the new member states). all the monitoring committees, including those for the community initiatives, are now operational and meet once or twice a year, or sometimes more frequently9. as provided for in the regulations, their work in 1996 was mainly of three types: project selection, the adjustment of programmes to the needs of actual implementation (particularly as regards the transition between the first and second phases of objective 2), and the introduction of interim assessment, comprising, for all assistance under the various objectives, the selection of independent assessors, the adoption of terms of reference for the assessment reports and the fixing of dates for these reports to be completed (normally mid-1997). this meant that the delay in getting started which occurred in 1995 was made up. careful monitoring as in previous years, the commission was involved in monitoring implementation on the ground, which entailed devoting considerable though to ways of improving and simplifying management of the structural funds in partnership with the member states10. this included implementation of the sem 2000 guidelines ('sound and efficient management'): beginning work on a better definition of expenditure eligible for part-financing under the structural funds and improvements to budget forecasting and the financial control system. the commission also continued to improve work on assessment, whether carried out on its own initiative or that of the member states11. this entailed support for the preparation of interim assessments to make them into programme management instruments, preparation of a detailed methodology for evaluating the account taken of the environment and equal opportunities, the completion of ex post evaluations from the previous period as part of the work on preparing the cohesion report, completion of an evaluation of major projects and the launching of thematic assessments on rtd, the environment, small firms and equal opportunities under the structural funds. in preparation for the new objective 2 programmes and the mid-term review of the programmes under the other objectives, the commission continued producing policy guidelines12 designed to achieve the main goal of creating new jobs, principally through the territorial pacts for employment. the commission issued communications to encourage culture and tourism as sources of economic activity to develop the regions. it also ensured that horizontal priorities such as the environment and equal opportunities are taken into account when programmes are actually implemented. a close eye was kept on the four principles underlying the 1988 reform of the funds. there was an improvement in the way partnership13 took shape in the monitoring committees although the situation varied depending on the assistance and the member state. realising that much remained to be done and could be done, the commission acted in three ways: a fresh start and the search for new forms of partnership through the territorial pacts for employment, increasing the capacity of the partners through training for the local-authority partners as well as for the economic and social partners, and consideration of ways of strengthening the partnership without loss of effectiveness as part of the broader consideration given to the shape of the funds after 1999. the principle of additionally stipulates that structural fund resources that are applied in all areas under a given objective in a member state should not replace public or comparable expenditure which would otherwise be eligible under the structural funds, ensuring that the community funding has full economic impact. in accordance with article 9 of the coordination regulation, the commission and the member state concerned verify, when programmes are established, that public structural or comparable expenditure is maintained at least at the same level as in the previous programming period. furthermore, to permit the on-going verification of this principle, the commission and the member state concerned agree the arrangements for verifying additionality at 9 see chapter v. summary by member state. 10 see chapter ii.b. checks and financial management. 11 see chapter tv. evaluation. 12 see chapter ii.d. complementary with the other community policies. 13 see chapter iii.b. regional partnership and chapter iii.c. dialogue with the economic and social partners. 8tk annual report on the structural funds (1996) 149 introduction evaluation in the context of the programming cycle the succession of structural fund programming periods makes it difficult to co-ordinate dates when the results of evaluations are available with those for programming or reprogramming decisions. there will inevitably be some lack of synchronisation in view of the fixed deadlines for programming decisions and the time required for launching and completing evaluation, especially ex post. nevertheless, it is possible to make operational use of the results of evaluations, giving them an active role in the construction or correction of multi-annual programmes. the principle is to combine the results of evaluations for earlier periods with the evaluation work under way. as measures are relatively continuous from one period to the next, the recent past can throw light on programmes under way. this principle is applied as follows in the three main stages of evaluation. \u0142 prior appraisal: the purpose of prior appraisal is to prepare the adoption of forthcoming programmes. it is based mainly on the examination of the programme prepared by the member state. three series of results may be used to fine-tune prior appraisal: the first review of the achievements of measures in the preceding period; the results will be only partial, since the figures were collated at the beginning of the final year of programming, but will give some idea of successes and failures over the period; the on-going assessment for the preceding period, drawing conclusions from the first years of activity and the subsequent reprogramming; and the results of thematic evaluations begun during implementation of the previous programme along with any other evaluation required by the special circumstances of the programme or of a particular measure. \u0142 on-going assessment: the role of on-going assessment is to verify whether the aims identified in the programme can be achieved, and to specify what adjustments need to be made to the programme to ensure that financing is used as efficiently as possible. on-going assessment is based on two main sources of information: the review of the early years of implementation of programming, obtained from the management reports of the monitoring committees; and the ex post evaluation of the previous programme - mainly for that part of the conclusions dealing with the same areas of assistance (many of which are covered for more than one period) - which is usually carried out at least two years after the end of programming. \u0142 ex post evaluation: ex post evaluation is completed several years after the end of the programming period. like prior assessment, it is based on the review drawn up before the end of the period, and on the results of thematic evaluations during the period. however, field surveys are the main source of information for ex post evaluation; they assess the real and lasting impact of assistance. the results of this work are basic to reliable on-going assessment in the following programming period. a. prior appraisal of objective 2 (1997-99) in the context of the preparation of the new objective 2 plans, and in conformity with its obligations under article 9(9) of the framework regulation, the commission carried out prior appraisal of the programmes in order to help improve their overall quality and effectiveness. in particular, the programmes needed to reflect the priorities identified in the policy guidelines on objective 2 for the period 1997-99, and to provide a sound methodological basis for the measurement of employment effects. lessons from the past : although not all evaluations of the 1994-96 programmes had been completed when the programmes were being prepared, some of the new spds demonstrated that lessons had been learnt from the previous programming period and incorporated into their preparation phase. this related in particular to the context, analysis and design of the strategy. a good example related to the 750 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) plan for aquitaine, where the evaluators played an important role in re-designing the strategy along clear and well-argued lines, as well as reinforcing synergies within the programme. more generally, plans based partly or wholly on evaluations or lessons learnt from previous programmes appear to have benefited from clearer and better focused strategies as a result. content and quality of the programmes in the prior appraisal, particular attention was paid by the assessors to the following elements : \u0142 the extent to which the, priorities outlined in the commission guidelines had been taken into account in the plans, and the degree to which they had been integrated within the proposed measures; \u0142 the quality of analysis of the area concerned, including the identification of the principal barriers to sustained growth and the identification of development potential; \u0142 an appreciation of the strategy presented in each spd, especially the coherence between the declared objectives and the resources devoted to their achievement; \u0142 the appropriateness of quantified indicators and targets, with particular regard to employment creation; \u0142 with regard to the environment, the key issues concerned the quality of the environmental assessment of the area concerned and the environmental impact of the strategy and related actions presented by the member states. respect for objective 2 guidelines: in general, the programmes included the policy areas emphasised in the guidelines although the content and quality of their integration into the proposed plans varied considerably between the regions. employment remained the main focus of all the programmes, although the effects of certain of the proposed measures on job creation were sometimes regarded by the evaluators as being too limited or indirect. most plans also favoured the promotion of smes and local potential as a driving force of regional economies, often associated, in the united kingdom plans for example, with the promotion of inward investment. a number of measures related to the environment but were focused on support for activities such as environmental and operational improvements to transport infrastructure and services rather than on business opportunities arising from environmental technologies. r&d and innovation-related actions were recognised as an important element in a strategic approach which sought to develop competitive and sustainable local businesses. such actions were, however, often under-represented in the financial structure of the programmes. the principle of equal opportunities for men and women was, however, in general only partially addressed, and most plans failed to integrate this issue horizontally with other themes within the overall strategy. swot analyses: the plans were generally well presented and their strategies are consistent with the economic development context. swot (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analyses were used in a more systematic way, although there was still scope for improvements in linking this instrument to the translation of the strategies into priorities and measures. strategic aims and objectives: the strategic approaches varied widely in terms of structure and contained differing degrees of geographical and sectoral orientation. in most cases, there was a strong degree of continuity of strategy between the new programmes and the previous period. strategic aims were expressed in many forms with job creation the most frequently mentioned aspect in the plans. within the global aim of achieving economic development, some programmes focused on absolute (or relative) improvements in certain socio-economic criteria such as employment, population and income. other strategic statements gave prominence to the conversion processes, e.g. diversification, modernisation or the target priorities of the strategy e.g. smes. almost all plans had clearly presented, explicit strategic objectives, contributing to a further development of the strategic statement. examples of aims embodied in strategic objectives included the growth of specific sectors such as tourism and transport, the exploitation of assets such as location and rtd facilities, and the nurturing of trends such as diversification of industrial activities, 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 151 strengthening competitiveness or greater entrepreneurial activity. some also highlighted horizontal aspects of economic development, such as environmental sustainability and equal opportunities. in particular, many plans contained some sectoral targeting (e.g. the french and italian plans) or \"drivers for change\", in particular in the dutch strategies, where there was an emphasis on the potential of knowledge-based approaches to develop new forms of economic activity. on average, the plans contained four strategic objectives, although these did not necessarily relate to the size of a programme, being more usually a measure of its complexity or number of development aspects. whilst most plans had explicit strategic objectives, it was not always clear how these had been derived from the regional economic analysis, or how the proposed programme of priorities and measures related to achieving them. targeting of measures: compared to the previous period, the number and the range of proposed measures increased significantly even for programmes with relatively limited funding. the focus of strategies was also often over a broad range of assistance, rather than on few crucial aspects of economic conversion. smes and local potential were the main target in almost all plans, in particular in italy where the proportion of resources devoted to these measures represented more than 50% of total funding. the accuracy of targeting of training measures was not always satisfactory, the fact that most of them were very large in financial terms perhaps reflecting their lack of focus. the environment is included in a limited number of measures, and particular attention was paid in some plans to the relationship between jobs and environment (e.g. zuid-limburg). in general, measures were consistent with the strategic objectives and the priorities of the plans. the majority of the measures contained concrete and quantified objectives, although baseline data should be provided. specific selection criteria relating to the priorities outlined in the plans, in particular job creation, need also to be reinforced. erdf and esf measures were better integrated compared to the previous period 1994-96. esf measures were better defined, although there shortcomings and unexploited opportunities were still evident as regards more innovative actions. examples of good practice can be identified in a number of regions (bremen, tuscany, some dutch regions) where management and co-ordination of training actions have been enhanced at local level. the spanish case is distinctive in that, whilst human resources measures can be linked in substance to specific erdf priorities, they are still presented separately. quantification of objectives and impacts: progress has been made in quantifying objectives and impacts although there is a need for further improvement in most plans. regional authorities should be encouraged to develop indicators which more effectively monitor the effect of measures and priorities. more careful consideration is also required of the quality of certain indicators as well as the accuracy of the targets. concerning the impact on employment, the methodological framework on \"ex-ante quantification of employment effects\" was transmitted to the member states. although indicators on measures and at programme level were generally listed, they were often insufficiently quantified. where quantification was available, little explanation was provided as to the basis of calculation of these effects. a notable exception, among others, was the aquitaine spd, where the commission's methodology had been widely followed and proved to be effective for monitoring and evaluation purposes. expected impact on employment: substantial progress has been made in quantifying employment effects in the 1997-99 spds. in 55 spds, detailed estimates have been provided at measure level corresponding to around 66% of total eu funding. most programmes focus on jobs created or safeguarded as a result of the assistance. they generally refer to gross jobs, and do not take account of deadweight and displacement effects. notable exceptions providing specific estimates of net job creation are some uk and french spds. data on gross job maintenance have been collected from the spds agreed, excluding those containing only global estimates. these data have been reclassified according to main areas of assistance in order to compare their relative efficiency in terms of average cost per job. the interpretation of these figures, is however, subject to caution in the absence of a standard methodology used in the various regions to estimate employment effects. 152 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) on the basis of these data, which would require further refinement, it is estimated that more than 870 000 gross jobs will be either created, saved or redistributed as a result of objective 2 assistance over the 1997-99 period. the order of magnitude is, according to recent evaluations, around the same as the programmes carried out over the 1989-93 period. temporary jobs represent a relatively small proportion of the overall employment effects, i.e. over 100 000 jobs for seven member states. the three main recipient member states (france, spain and united kingdom), which account for around 70% of total eu funding, contribute more than two-thirds of the gross jobs. the average cost per job -based on erdf and esf funding - is estimated at ecu 13 800. considerable variation exists in the eu cost per job, ranging from an average of around ecu 4 400 in spain to an average of around ecu 24 000 in denmark. an explanation for this lies in the priorities pursued in the various objective 2 strategies. in particular, 'here infrastructure investment is a priority, the job creation effects will take longer to become ap, ; ' ;h?v elsewhere and this will be reflected in a higher cost per job than in other regions where tht ; v \u0142* s on. for example, sme support which has more immediate impacts. table iv-1: objective 2,1997-99 - expected i-^rjict on employment temporary lobs created or maintained jobs

environmental assessment and address a number of environmental issues. some plans presented detailed information following a standard format, with a matrix detailing possible impacts of measures/actions against environmental concerns and issues. however, this strategic assessment should be integrated in most plans with the provision of suitable environmental indicators. another notable improvement concerns the association of environmental authorities, which is more widely accepted as part of the plans. as regards the inclusion of environmental issues, the link between measure and programme level has to be reinforced as well. furthermore, environmental measures are often linked to the stimulation of local activity. they are rarely preventive in nature and there is no mention in most plans of the \"polluter pays\" principle or information on its concrete application. an example of good practice is the finnish plan, whose special feature is the inclusion of prior appraisal of environmental impact and the involvement of environmental authorities in decision making, monitoring and evaluation (at programme and project level). b. on-going assessment the purpose of on-going assessment is to see how far the objectives pursued are being achieved, on the evidence of the implementation of structural fund programmes and the external environment. these assessments constitute a valuable management tool for the monitoring committees, for they contribute to decisions on changes to the programmes. as a rule, for programmes lasting for more than three years, a mid-term assessment is made after the first three years. for three-year objective 2 programmes, interim assessment of the first stage replaces the mid-term assessment. the 7th annual report (1995) explained that as a general rule, because of legal requirements, the interim assessment process for 6-year programming should comprise three stages: a preliminary report on the feasibility of the assessment, covering an analysis of the quality and content of the programming document and of the monitoring system established; a mid-term assessment report prepared after the third year of activity (i.e. 1996), followed by additional reports; and a first summary report at the end of 1999 which would provide the preparatory work for the final ex post evaluation. in the case of objective 2. the mid-term report would be replaced by an analysis before the end of 1996. 8th annual report on the structural fund's (1996) 153 during 1996, good progress was made with setting up assessment arrangements in most of the objective 1 regions. except in italy, the monitoring committees issued invitations to tender for the selection of independent assessors. almost one hundred bodies were selected to carry out on-going assessments. preliminary reports were drafted in most of the regions to verify the conditions for programme evaluability, and, where necessary, to flesh out the systems of indicators in the programmes. mid-term reports will be available in the course of 1997, so that where necessary, assistance can be reprogrammed. with specific reference to the programmes concerning human resources under objective 1, which are major programmes involving significant volumes of financing in both relative and absolute terms, one interesting topic for on-going assessment is an analysis of how national policies have been reoriented as a result of the assistance financed. for example, emphasis in the period 1994-99 on socially-excluded groups was a major innovation in certain objective 1 countries. nevertheless, the priority for assessment is still the impact of reinforcing education and training systems. on questions of implementation, the preliminary mid-term assessment reports give an initial idea of where the bottlenecks lie, in particular at the level of monitoring and information systems, and the selection of projects, often limited to a formal analysis of eligibility criteria for expenditure. on the methodological side, in most of the objective 1 regions, the inclusion of a set of indicators in the programmes was a major innovation of the 1993 reform of the structural funds. \"evaluability\" is a recurring theme in the reports received so far. for rural and agricultural development programmes under objective 1, with measures applying on a nation-wide scale, an assessor has been appointed. mid-term reports have already been presented for ireland and northern ireland. there was a more specific report for ireland, relating to the establishment of young farmers. it highlights the practical difficulties, caused chiefly by problems of succession and the high cost of capital investment tevstart up a holding. for objective 2, assessment has got under way in most regions. altogether, 50 assessors have been selected by the monitoring committees, with the exception of the united kingdom. in certain cases, on-going assessment was used for the preparation of the spds for 1997-99, where it made possible an initial review of assistance and enabled lessons to be learned about the strategy to follow and the type of measure to undertake. the aquitaine region is a good example of this type of practice, with assessors playing an active role in the preparation of the programme, especially in terms of quantifying objectives and impacts. for objectives 3 and 4, the mid-term assessment process has also begun, with the appointment of independent assessors, the establishment of steering groups and the submission of the first preliminary report. these reports contain initial conclusions on programming, implementation and measurement of impact. for objective 3, the priority of the mid-term assessment is to gain an initial idea of concentration on target groups and of the nature of community value added. available assessment reports show the different ways programming is implementation in the member states. in certain cases, assistance increases the capacity of the arrangements part-financed in specific areas, and in others the esf has acted as an incentive to the creation of new arrangements (this is the. case, in particular for \"personalised integration pathways\"). the community value added associated with these modes of assistance is very different. on the methodological side, the indicators are mainly the \"classic\" indicators of results at the level of beneficiaries (certification, immediate placement rates). few indicators of specific results at the level of measures were planned. analysis of objective 4 programming shows widely varying interpretations, depending on the strategic choices of the member states but also on the national background. two of the themes proposed for mid-term assessment are the participation of smes and the notion of workers threatened with .unemployment. an initial examination of the selection criteria provided important pointers to policy priorities. in certain cases, these criteria have not so far played their filtering role, since the novelty of the approach and the delay in implementation have led to a somewhat limited supply of projects. another reason for the lack of projects may be that promoters must go through a learning process, as they are more used to measures like those of objective 3. 154 8ih annual report on the structural funds (1996) under objective 5(b), efforts made in 1996 resulted in the establishment of assessment structures in the regions: a work programme, a working group appointed under the monitoring committee to monitor assessment, terms of reference for the selection of the assessor, and an assessor appointed for each programme. the procedure, in the framework of the monitoring committees, has been completed for all 83 spds under objective 5(b). the monitoring committees understand the special nature of this exercise, since assessment helps improve management of the programmes and the forthcoming changes (1997-99). so far, assessment has been positive, since, with a few exceptions, most national and regional authorities represented in the committees have understood the need for a transparent and professional assessment. the vast majority of contracts were awarded following a public call for tenders. the other condition for a useful assessment is that it should be ready on time. the monitoring committees therefore all asked for mid-term reports by the summer of 1997 (with some exceptions for the new member states). certain regions had already submitted an initial progress report before the final report, which, in most cases, was to be ready for the end of the first half of 1997. a data-base recording all the indicators in the programmes and their quantification has been set up by the commission. it should make it possible to monitor the implementation of each programme, especially at the level of physical data and employment, and to produce national and community aggregates. similarly, most of the fifg monitoring committees issued invitations to tender for the selection of independent assessors for on-going assessment reports. these reports were expected in the first half of 1997. in finland and sweden, objective 6 monitoring committees set up on-going assessment procedures. the invitations to tender were issued on time, and the bodies were selected. mid-term reports are expected towards the end of 1997. on-going assessment has also been organised for certain community initiatives. for leader ii, certain regions have decided to assess cips in the same framework as objective 5(b). for others, especially in the member states where programmes are established at national level, specific procedures have been introduced. the irish report has already been submitted, and it shows that the programme has made good progress, with stress laid on acquisition of expertise and transmission of experience for new local action groups, but also that difficulties have been encountered in the introduction and running of measures. for employment and adapt cips too, arrangements for assessment on a partnership basis were introduced in 1996. priorities for on-going assessment are directly linked to the nature of the initiatives themselves, which means assessing how the principles of trans-nationality and innovation are reflected in the implementation of programmes and whether the results of the measures are disseminated with a view to the \"mainstreaming\" of good practice. c. ex post evaluation 1. objective 2 1989-93 in the course of 1996, structural fund assistance was evaluated in the 60 areas eligible under objective 2 in the period 1989-93, to assess the main results obtained and to help improve the operation of present and future measures. the ex post evaluations involved examining certain specific questions, such as: what impact did objective 2 assistance have? how far did it contribute to industrial conversion in the areas? how far did the 1988 reform of the structural funds improve the implementation of the programmes, and their results? what lessons can be learned from the evaluation of objective 2 programmes for 1989-93, and incorporated in a code of good practice? the main obstacle to this evaluation was that, in a number of objective 2 areas, relatively little information was available on the outcome of the programmes for 1989-93. where information was available, performance indicators applied were not standardised, or not sufficiently comparable. consequently, the results and conclusions presented below should be regarded as merely indicative. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 155 main conclusions in general, the conclusion of ex post evaluation is that assistance under objective 2 played a major role in the process of industrial conversion in the period 1989-93. while global macro-economic trends were not favourable for much of the period, objective 2 programmes helped to sustain the process of structural adjustment in the regions affected by the decline of traditional industrial sectors. the short-term impact on unemployment and the long-term contribution to industrial restructuring were considerable. the evaluation also highlights the major effects of the 1988 reform of the structural funds. strategies implemented the strategies adopted for csfs and ops made for coherent regional development strategies in many objective 2 areas that did not have such strategies. the framework defined in 1989 by the european commission highlighted the need, in line with the reform of the structural funds, to adopt a more integrated, focused and programme-oriented approach to the process of industrial conversion. the results of research in certain regions, e.g. in spain, italy and the united kingdom, suggest that this framework forms a more solid base for regional development programming than before, even if certain aspects of the regulations governing the structural funds are regarded as too restrictive. in the regions where a strategic approach to regional development was well-established (france and germany), this aspect of the value added by objective 2 was less pronounced. the leverage effect of the structural funds was considerable: for every million ecu of community money, a further ecu 2 million was committed by the member states. the funds also elicited private sector financing, which accounted overall for about 20% of objective 2 programme expenditure. it is difficult to assess the extent of financial additionality, but research shows that structural fund aid was crucial to enabling objective 2 programming to continue, at least at the pace and in the volume achieved. objective 2 priorities were broadly similar in the various regions; but major differences were noted in the breakdown of resources between types of measure. as a rule, the breakdown of resources between measures reflected development priorities in the regions. for example, in the french and spanish regions, the emphasis was on infrastructure investment, but elsewhere (e.g. the netherlands, italy and certain regions of the united kingdom), support for the development of smes, tourism and human resources was more important. at the level of projects, the allocation of financing did not always reflect the strategic priorities, however. the degree of external coherence was generally high, despite certain problems in adapting to csfs in the member states with existing well-established regional strategies. however, strategies often lacked internal coherence, with a few exceptions (e.g. the netherlands). this applies in particular to the integration of erdf and esf measures. differences in administrative procedures, institutional structures and responsibilities at national level made integration difficult. on the other hand, at the level of projects, the development of partnership in the objective 2 regions helped to optimise links and synergies between measures. management of programmes because of the need to commit resources rapidly at the beginning of the 1989-93 programming period, the regional authorities in some cases introduced formal procedures for the appraisal and selection of projects after programmes had commenced. delays in setting up csfs and ops mean that the regional authorities were initially under pressure to commit financing over a relatively short period. there was therefore a widespread tendency to take projects \"off the shelf or to select projects on the basis of \"first come, first served\". the introduction of official appraisal criteria and procedures began, in most regions, when competition for financing grew keener. it would seem that by the end of the period, a much more rigorous approach was adopted for the evaluation of projects in most regions. the most 156 8th annual report an the structural funds (1996) sophisticated appraisal methods are probably those devised in the netherlands and the united kingdom (where scoring, weighting and ranking methods were tested). in general, programme monitoring and evaluation practices proved inadequate, despite the measures adopted at the end of the period to reinforce them. in most regions, monitoring procedures were limited to checking financial indicators, with minor importance given to scrutiny of physical results. research shows that, in most regions, the regional authorities had neither the expertise nor the resources for efficient monitoring of projects. for example, site visits do not appear to have been organised on a large scale. most regions also encountered technical problems in analysing and using the monitoring data collected. there were few global mid-term assessments, although considerable research has been done into specific projects and specific aspects of programmes. in several regions, the shortcomings of monitoring and evaluation practices were one of the factors explaining the general lack of a strategic approach to reprogramming. it is nevertheless clear that measures were taken at the end of the period to improve procedures. approaches to programme management were not standardised; they were strongly influenced by institutional structures and national traditions in the objective 2 regions. broadly speaking, there seem to have been two types of approach: highly centralised structures (e.g. in spain) and more decentralised structures (e.g. in the netherlands, italy and the united kingdom). the monitoring committees played a major role in most regions, acting as a link between national, regional and local authorities and between the various economic and social partners in the regions. their capacity to exercise genuine decision-making powers did vary, however: in certain regions, it seems to have been quite extensive, but in others (e.g. in germany), it was much more limited. with the 1988 reform of the structural funds, the partnership process gained considerable impetus. research points to this as one of the major and most lasting benefits of objective 2 assistance in the period 1989-93. it is also clear that major problems arose in the early stages. in some regions - in particular those whose administrative structures are relatively centralised - tensions arose between national and regional authorities on the matter of prerogatives for the setting of priorities and decision-making. in certain member states, it was difficult to obtain a contribution from the private sector. however, it is clear that all the partners were going through a learning process, and that at the end of the period 1989-93, generally efficient partnership had been established in all the regions covered by objective 2. several partnership models have been developed: where the number of participants is relatively limited, the partnerships are more cohesive and easier to manage, while wider partnerships, although more representative, were often more difficult to co-ordinate. here again, the type of model adopted tended to reflect specific features of the regions, in particular the size of objective 2 areas. objective 2 strategies underwent a major adjustment during the programming period, but its purpose was to ensure maximum take-up of available financing rather than to change the regional development priorities. however, several regions adjusted programming to take account of the lessons of the period 1989-91. on the whole, where the effect of the adjustment was to shift the emphasis from infrastructure investment to measures liable to be of immediate benefit to employment, this was a good thing, in view of the incipient recession and the rise in unemployment rates. gross and net results it is estimated that almost 850 000 gross jobs were created, saved or redistributed following measures under objective 2 during the period 1989-93. after adjustment for additionality, the displacement effect and indirect effects, it is estimated that 450 000 to 500 000 net additional jobs altogether can be attributed to objective 2 programmes. of the 850 000 gross jobs, some 570 000 (or 67%) were due to erdf programmes, with the remainder resulting from esf assistance. three member states, france, spain and the united kingdom, accounted for about 3/4 of the gross jobs created or maintained, which corresponds broadly to the distribution of appropriations between the member states. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 157 the average cost per job, on the basis of erdf and esf expenditure, is \"estimated at ecu 7 000 (gross) or ecu 14 000 (net). there was wide variation between the member states in cost per job for estimated basic net job creation (450 000), from an average of about ecu 5 000 in belgium to an average of ecu 20 000 in th\u00e9 spanish objective 2 regions. the reason for this can be found in the priorities pursued in the different regions covered by objective 2. in particular, where infrastructure investment is a priority, induced effects on job creation are slower to materialise than in regions where the emphasis is on measures such as aid to smes, and this leads to a higher cost per job during the programming period. taking both national and community expenditure on objective 2 programmes gives an average or global/real cost per net job of ecu 40 000. this figure is within the range expected for regional development measures. results of objective 2 programming for 1989-93 also show an estimated 917 000 beneficiaries of training programmes supported by the esf, and approximately 470 000 beneficiary smes. as few regional authorities set targets at the beginning of the programming period, it is not easy to assess the degree to which the programmes have been successful. information collected in the course of research shows that in only twelve of the 60 objective 2 areas did the regional authorities set targets for erdf measures in terms of employment. the authorities in 20 regions had set quantified targets for esf measures. where targets were set, they seem, in most cases, to have been not only achieved but actually exceeded. in certain cases, this may mean that performance really was better than expected, but it may also be that the targets themselves were not sufficiently realistic, or that monitoring systems were not capable of accurate measurement of programme results. impact assessment structural fund assistance helped to ensure economic diversification of the regions, since the jobs created or maintained between 1989 and 1993 were equivalent to an estimated 0.7% to 1.3% of non-industrial jobs. the impact of objective 2 measures on employment is certainly an important yardstick for measuring achievements, but the strategies adopted were essentially designed to address deep-seated structural weakness over a longer period. from this point of view, the contribution of structural fund measures to the diversification of the economies of the objective 2 regions, and to reducing their dependence on traditional industrial sectors as a source of jobs and income, is a critical measure of success. in most of the objective 2 regions, the conversion process was well under way at the end of the 1980s, but it is clear that structural fund measures played a major role in sustaining the process. moreover, objective 2 programming slowed down the loss of industrial jobs: the level of employment was 0.9% to 1.8% higher than it would have been without assistance. as the programming period 1989-93 largely coincided with a deep recession, structural fund assistance to maintain jobs in declining industrial sectors clearly served important social and economic aims. its impact is demonstrated by the fact that some 0.9% or 1.8% of industrial jobs (depending on whether gross or net effects are considered) were created or maintained thanks to objective 2 prograrriming. apart from the effects highlighted above, the evaluation also indicates that objective 2 assistance had a considerable non-measurable impact. the most significant was probably the way it stimulated the development of regional partnerships and their capacity to plan and manage regional development strategies. the 1988 reform of the structural funds certainly had a major impact from this point of view. the repercussions of other changes made in 1988, especially the new emphasis on the principles of concentration, additionally and programming, are more difficult to assess. 16 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the time when the prognunrning documents are adopted. the member state provides the commission with relevant financial information and indications of the transparency of the financial flows in question. after the prograiriming period, an ex post verification is carried out to ascertain whether the member state has complied with its undertakings to maintain the ]evel of expenditure in question. during 1994, 1995 and 1996, the prior appraisal of virtually all the programmes for objectives 1, 214 and 6 was completed. however, two problems remained at the end of 1996: objective 1 in france, where the commission was still awaiting an update of the figures in the spds, and objective 2 in luxembourg (1994-96), where the lack of any financial information on additionality made it impossible to resume suspended payments. in 1996, the first steps were taken towards prior verification of additionality under the objective 2 spds for 1997-99. data provided by the national authorities in finland demonstrated compliance with this principle before the end of the year. further information about all the other member states was expected early in 1997. the arrangements for the on-going assessment of additionality form part of the programming documents and are an obligation arising from the partnership agreement with each member state. they entail the annual updating of the data initially provided in the programming documents. at the end of 1996, the results of the on-going assessment of additionality were mixed. a number of member states (austria, belgium, france, netherlands and the united kingdom for objective 1 ; finland and sweden for objective 6) had sent the commission no up-to-date figures. germany, spain, greece and italy reported eligible national public expenditure lower than estimated in the prior verification of objective 1 and, in accordance with monitoring rules, the commission is awaiting explanations. portugal has sent data on a number of occasions but methodological improvements are still expected. in 1996 the ex post verification of additionality covered the objective 1 programmes for 1989-93 and the objective 2 programmes for 1994-96. in the case of objective 1, the situation was satisfactory for spain and ireland but for portugal the data sent require adjustment and in the case of greece a methodological problem had to be resolved to compare the data for the two programming periods. france and italy did not send the commission the information required. in the case of objective 2, where the prior appraisal for 1997-99 and the ex post assessment for 1994-96 are being carried out in parallel, further information on the period 1994-96 was expected early in 1997. this also applied to the prior appraisal of the objective 2 spds. despite delays and problems in the submission of data, the implementation of the principle of additionality has involved close and intensive cooperation between the commission and the member states. although much still remains to be done to ensure the systematic transmission of uniform data to the commission, substantial progress has already been made and this will facilitate work in the future. considerable financial activity the main task in 1996 consisted of clear progress in making up the backlog, where too the situation varies depending on the objective and the member state15. after the first three years, half the assistance from the various objectives had been committed by the commission and one third had been paid. financial activity in 1996 alone accounted for 37% of commitments made since 1994 (as against 28% for 1994 and 35% for 1995) and 44% of payments for that period (as against 21% for 1994 and 35% for 1995). similarly, the community initiatives took off dramatically, with over half the assistance committed (thanks to the system of single commitments for amounts of less than ecu 40 million) and 22% paid. for most of the initiatives 1996 was the year when they really began operations. 14 programmes for 1994-96. 15 see in particular chapter i. the implementation of assistance. j58 rth annual report on the structural funds (1996) 2. other ex post evaluations in 1996, certain objective 5(b) areas completed evaluations taking stock of results of the period 1989-93. some member states also decided to compile summaries' of the contents of the various evaluations, although without enhancing the precision of figures for final results and impact. the datar (france) undertook a study into evaluation methods for community programmes, and the problems encountered, assessing the dynamics of approaches adopted in different regions. after a public invitation to tender issued in 1995, an assessor was selected for the leader i initiative in 1996, and the study, which is to cover 217 local action groups in the twelve member states, began the same year. the first step was to produce a methodological report as a basis for forthcoming work in the member states, with an original method for assessing innovation and the \"bottom-up\" approach. d. assessment of major projects 1. introduction in 1996 a survey of appraisals of major projects attracting assistance from the erdf and cohesion fund was carried out. it was an update of a survey looking at major projects in the first prograrriming period (1989-93). the first.survey, corrimissioned in 1994, examined the cost-benefit analyses (cba) of 200 major projects approved for erdf part-financing between 1989 and 1993. the cbas were a requirement of article 5 of the erdf regulations for applications for the part-financing of major projects. the aims of the exercise were to assess the overall quality of appraisal data; to compare the different methods of analysis used; and to identify key issues for the evaluation of major projects in 1994-99. the survey results are summarised in the \"fifth annual report on the implementation of reform of the structural funds 1993\" published in 1995. the results were also used in drawing up the guide to cost benefit analysis of major projects, in the context of ec regional policies, which was published in 1995. both the guide and the results of the survey of major projects 1989 to 1993 were used in the preparation of training seminars for commission officials dealing with major projects. in 1996 a new survey of the major projects, with similar aims to the first, was commissioned. once again 200 project applications were examined, split this time between 107 erdf projects and 93 cohesion fund projects. the cohesion fund projects are applications for projects agreed in the period 1993 to 1996. the erdf projects are for the period 1994-99. although this sample cannot be considered to be fully representative of the major projects part-financed, it is nonetheless significant. in examining the results a number of things should be borne in mind. the information is that available at the time of the survey, june 1996 and is principally derived from applications. in some cases these are different from the final outcomes. the quality of the cbas was considered in relation to best practice, and any criticisms do not necessarily imply that the applications themselves did not meet the regulator\u00bb' requirements. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 159 table iv-2: major projects

an additional five countries are included. germany, which was not included in the first survey, accounts for 28 of the 200 projects examined. the contributions from italy, ireland and portugal are much reduced in the second survey, although they are still significant. the cohesion fund projects are split between the transport and environment sectors. two-fifths of the erdf projects are also in the transport sector, while relatively few major erdf projects are in the environment sector. transport represents the bulk of expenditure too, some 60%. environment projects tend to be smaller than average, and expenditure on them makes up less than 10% of the total. energy projects by contrast tend to be expensive, and the three projects in the sample account for 12% of expenditure. table tv-3:

estimation of shadow prices evaluation of externalities financial analysis changes in relative prices financial rate of return financial planning risk analysis sensitivity analysis risk analysis + improvement from the first to the second generation - deterioration from the first to the second generation cost-benefit analysis is an established method for estimating the economic benefit of projects. the principle behind it is simple. the costs and benefits are listed, valued in money terms, added up, and the total costs subtracted from the total benefits. in practice, though, the development of useful and comparable results involves considerable work. accounting for time: the present worth of future costs and benefits is less than that of those occurring now. thus, it is first necessary to estimate the stream of costs and benefits that come from the project over time, and second, reduce the value of those that: occur later. in practice, it is normally assumed that the rate at which value falls over time (the discount rate) is constant. in deciding whether or not to invest, private companies often use discount rates of 20-30% or more. projections over time are available in over 70% of second generation projects. on average the projections for the transport sector were for 20-30 years, for the environment and water sector they were usually a little longer, while the projects for industrial, service, education and health sectors were based on projections for 6 to 13 years. in general, the different horizons reasonably reflect the nature of the investment. rate of return: once the costs and benefits have been valued and set out over time and a suitable discount rate applied, subtracting the total costs from the total benefits results in the net present value (npv) of the project. an alternative measure is the internal rate of return (irr). in most projects, the costs occur early, and the benefits arrive later. thus the higher the discount rate, the lower the npv. the financial irr reflects the actual financial position of the project. the proportion of cba appraisals that have estimated financial irrs, about a quarter, has remained the same. however, there has been a decrease in the proportion of appraisals which contain details of the data on financial planning used in calculating the financial irr. in some cases, more approximate financial indicators, such as the profit/income ratio, were given. in other cases, the calculation was not made because no income was forecast. about 70% of project proposals provided an assessment of the economic irr (i.e. after adjusting the price of a good or service artificially inflated by a monopoly) compared to 50% of the first generation projects. the survey suggests that both financial and economic irrs were of a similar order of magnitude in both generations of projects. sensitivity and risk: two elements can be distinguished: an examination of the sensitivity of the forecasts to changes in the assumptions, and an appraisal of outcomes in the light of the risks attached to the project. in general, the treatment of uncertainty has been better in the second generation of projects. progress varied across sectors, with improvements in the transport and energy sector, but a deterioration in the industry sector. there were no risk assessments in the 200 projects examined - a marked deterioration in relation to the previous period. however, it should be noted that the regulations do not require the provision of sensitivity or risk analyses. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 161 conclusion: the different composition of the two surveys makes them'difficult to compare. in general, there has been a marked improvement in the quality of the cbas presented in the applications for the funding of large projects. however, there is still room for improvement. the publication of the guide to cost benefit analysis of major projects will have brought about improvements in the cbas, as will the increased attention to evaluation that has been shown in the implementation of structural funds. e. thematic evaluation and other evaluation activities in 1996, the commission decided to launch a series of thematic evaluations of the impact of structural funds in a number of key areas, such as research and development, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the environment. it is expected that the outcomes of the evaluations will be used to better target expenditure on those areas that are most effective; to improve monitoring systems so that they are better able to provide accurate, timely, useful information for the better managing and evaluation of the implementation of the structural funds; and to refine evaluation tools in these areas. the work will be launched at the end of 1997, and will last a year to 18 months. evaluation of measures financed by the esf in the framework of the european social dialogue the 1988 esf regulation was the first sign of the community's concern to take account, in the context of the social dialogue, of the massive advent in the working environment of new technologies with a substantial impact on the labour market, both in quantitative and in qualitative terms. the esf is able to finance \"operations directed, within the framework of social dialogue, at staff from enterprises in two or more member states and concerning the transfer of special knowledge relating to modernisation of the production apparatus\". the assessment of training measures in the framework of the social dialogue has produced preliminary results. the measures as such are of good quality. the social dialogue does not appear as a theme in the content of measures closely related to the themes of \"industrial change\" developed in the framework of objective 4 and adapt. the commission's guidelines on the application of social dialogue measures were welcomed, since they clarified the concepts and the procedures. nevertheless, their application highlighted a number of shortcomings such as the lack of linkage between these measures and the social dialogue at european level, which is considered solely as a general framework; the need to increase the specificity of the measures financed under article 6 of the esf regulation in terms of the other community measures involving the participation of the social partners, and a lack of suitable esf selection procedures. clarification of the objectives of social dialogue measures would seem necessary to render them more operational and encourage links with complementary programmes. the social dialogue dimension should be reinforced, which means closer co-ordination between departments within the commission and between the commission and the social partners. the means programme 1996 saw the second year of implementation of the three-year programme of methods for the evaluation of actions of a structural nature, or the means programme (after its title in french). this programme, operated by the centre europ\u00e9en d'expertise en evaluation (ceee), aims to strengthen the capacity of the commission to manage structural funds and to be accountable for the public expense involved. there were three major priorities: first, to draw up reference frameworks for the three main types of evaluation (prior appraisal, mid-term assessment and ex post evaluation); next, to develop evaluation techniques. a number of workshops took place in which academic experts, experienced officials from central and regional authorities in member states and various commission departments participated. as a result of these deliberations three means handbooks were published on improving the quality of evaluations, evaluating employment effects of the structural funds, and assessing the synergy effects of the programmes. in addition, progress was made in workshops on the development of impact indicators. 162 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) a conference on evaluation techniques was held in berlin m december 1996. it brought together over 300 policy makers, managers of structural fund programmes and projects, and evaluation specialists. the conference focused on six questions, around which there was discussion, the sharing of experience, and examination of evaluation techniques: how to measure the impact of the multi-annual programme approach which covers a wide range of structural measures at different levels; how to measure the macroeconomic effect of structural fund assistance that accounts for a significant percentage of the member state's gdp; the adaptation of macroeconomic and other methods to examine the impacts of programmes in the small regions in receipt of objective 2 and 5(b) funding; the measurement of the structural funds employment impact; the role of thematic evaluations in the on-going assessment phase, and appropriate methods to carry them out; and the definition of indicators and of quality criteria. g* \u01421 6 3 parte the structural funds in detail \u01424 6^ chapter v summary by member state 8th annual report on the structural

technological development features in several of the priorities in the development strategy for hainaut and involves a full range of measures: \u0142 development of centres of excellence (research centres, institutions and universities), technological support for businesses, international partnership and dissemination of scientific and technical culture in educational, scientific and business circles, development of communications centres in universities, research centres, training institutes and firms (rdt priority: ecu 85.9 million; total cost: ecu 188.8 million); \u0142 research on new agricultural products and technological innovation in businesses, \u0142 development of human potential in rtd (ecu 13.2 million; total cost: ecu 26 million) and training in advanced communications (technical training of technicians in firms and unemployed people, communications demonstration and information measures, utilisation by managers) (sub-priority communications: ecu 1 million; total cost: ecu 2 million); \u0142 under the human resources priority, innovation awareness (ecu i million; total cost: ecu 2 million). objective 2 (1994-96): the four spds all provide assistance for technological innovation, either as part of support for industry or services (aubange, limburg and turnhout), or as a priority in itself(meuse- vesdre): \u0142 aubange: in-house training in businesses concerned with new technologies and growth sectors, training for young people, creation of inter-company training schemes (ecu 0.2 million; total cost: ecu0.6 million); \u0142 limburg and turnhout: thematic workshops and measures to encourage cooperation and technology transfer between industry and the service sector (ecu 0.8 million; total cost: ecu 2 million); stimulation of r&d in the field of the environment (for both regions: ecu 0.3 million; total cost: ecu 8.5 million); \u0142 meuse-vesdre (ecu 16.8 million; total cost: ecu 40.5 million): development of r&d centres of excellence to help equip firms to participate in community programmes and international research projects; cooperation between firms and research centres and development of new products and production methods; training in innovation and the development of human resources in universities and research centres. concerning more specifically data transmission applications in connection with the development of the information society, only limburg and turnhout have planned measures, in the context of development of business accommodation. only limburg has provided for development of telecommunications to maximise growth of the service sector in the region. objective 5(b): the spds for westhoek and meetjesland provide for technology transfer among the measures to develop businesses, research projects, telematics services and new agricultural products, and upgrade natural resources. in total, structural fund assistance for technological development accounts for 13.6% of appropriations in belgium

outlook for the second phase, i.e. 1997-99, in the light of the results to date. so far, implementation of measures to support investment by businesses has been brisk: all the erdf appropriations for the 'aide' measure, designed to assist the development of smes employing less than 20 people, were used up within the year, while there was considerable uptake of the appropriations for the 'ace' measure, to assist the creation of businesses employing more than 20 people, towards the end of the year as the measure picked up steam. by contrast, measures to increase the region's attractiveness made little progress (4.6% of appropriations had been absorbed by the end of 1996). measures under the esf include continuing training for the work force, reintegration of the unemployed in the labour market and modernisation of vocational training systems. measures part-financed by the eaggf account for approximately 7% of total financing under the spd. more than half of these funds are allocated to horizontal measures, the remainder concerning rural development (local products, farm tourism, pony-trekking, etc). management of these measures has resulted in good utilisation of appropriations. the small allocation from the fifg, intended to increase the production of 'escabeche' was increased in 1996 by ecu 0.8 million by means of a transfer of appropriations from the eaggf. measures financed by the fifg have made relatively slow progress. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-96 in view of the substantial consumption of appropriations under the 'aide' measure, the monitoring committee decided, firstly, to increase the budget for the measure by ecu 33 million from the erdf by reducing the appropriations allocated to measures deemed less pressing or making slower progress, secondly, to change the rate of erdf part-financing for the measure, and, thirdly, to target it on manufacturing, a priority sector, (except for sectors assisted by the ftfg, the eaggf or the ecsc) and services to businesses (including distribution centres and investments in logistic support to transport companies, but not including investments in movable transport infrastructure and courier services). in addition, negotiations were commenced, but not completed, in 1996 with the walloon agencies with a view to improving the arrangements for implementing economic promotion measures for smes. lastly, the entire financing plan for the spd was amended to take account of the progress make by the different measures and the financial adjustments arising from various transfers or from the allocation of additional funds resulting from the indexing for 1994 to 1995. only eligible region: hainaut. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 167 objective 22 fie. v-2: prorrammine

four spds for 1994-96 were closed. since the appropriations initially programmed for three of them (meuse-vesdre (liege), limburg and turnhout) had not yet been fully committed at the end of 1996, some allocations had to be transferred to 1997-99. in total ecu 28.7 million were transferred, i.e. 18% of the appropriations available for 1994-96. the transfer for the spd for meuse-vesdre amounted to ecu 9.6 million (11% of initial assistance). it was mainly due to under-utilisation for three measures: \"development of business facilities\" (temporary business premises and service parks), \"rehabilitation and redevelopment of derelict industrial sites\" and \"environmental infrastructure\". in addition, the financing plan was adjusted by transferring appropriations between measures. the chief transfer concerns a ecu 4 million increase in the erdf contribution to the \"centres of excellence\" measure, the purpose of which is to strengthen the ability of research centres to help businesses located in the eligible area. these appropriations were taken from measures to stimulate innovation in businesses which could not be implemented. in july 1996 agreement was reached on the arrangements for implementing the venture capital measure, which could then proceed. in the case of the spd for turnhout, ecu 5.6 million of unutilised appropriations were transferred (24% of initial assistance), while the annual instalments for 1994 and 1995 were closed and the first instalment for 1996 was committed. the transfer of appropriations to 1997-99 for the limburg spd amounted to ecu 13.5 million (29% of initial assistance) and, as in the case of turnhout, the annual instalments for 1994 and 1995 were closed and the first instalment for 1996 was committed. the spd for aubange was closed, since all community appropriations had already been committed at national level before the closing date of 31 december 1996, once the monitoring committee had decided, in december 1996, to make transfers between measures and allocate the indexing, taking account of the programme's implementation. this led to an increase in the erdf contribution to the \"business facilities\" measure (temporary business premises and service parks) and a reduction in the esf contribution. preparation of the 1997-99 programming period preparations for 1997-99 were also commenced in the second half of 1996 for each of the new spds, with no change in the eligible areas from one phase to the next. preparations were still underway at the end of 1996, and some important points were still being discussed, for example in the case of the spd for meuse-vesdre. in the main, the structure of the next wave of programmes is similar to those of the first phase. this is true, for example, of the spds for turnhout and limburg, except that, for turnhout, a new priority for \"local economy\" has been included and the allocation for infrastructure and premises for businesses has been reduced while that for innovation and technology development has been increased. similarly, in the case of limburg, a new measure entitled \"local employment initiative\" has been included in each priority, while the overall structure of the programme is eligible regions: aubange, meuse-vesdre (li\u00e8ge), limburg, turnhout. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 17 execution of the community budget for the structural funds was virtually 100% in 199616. taking all the funds, all the forms of assistance and all types of appropriations together, ecu 26.141 billion was committed of the ecu 26.587 billion available, a rate of 98% while rates in the first two years of programrning were around 90%. payments totalled ecu 22.448 billion out of ecu 23.678 billion available, a rate of 95% as compared with 81% in 1995. this very satisfactory rate of implementation in 1996 and the increase in appropriations available as a result of the edinburgh decisions meant that the amounts implemented in 1996 increased very sharply: by 19% (ecu 4.203 billion) over 1995 in the case of commitments and by 30% (ecu 5.233 billion) in the case of payments. commitments under the various objectives totalled ecu 23.117 billion (89% of total commitments), of which objectiv\u00e9 1 accounted for 66% (ecu 15.369 billion). shares of total commitments by fund ranged from 2% for the ftfg (ecu 406.6 billion) to 53% for the erdf (ecu 13.802 billion); all except the fifg committed all the appropriations available. payments under the objectiv\u00e9s amounted to ecu 20.445 billion (91% of total payments), of which objective 1 accounted for 72%. shares of total payments by fund ranged from 2% for the fifg (ecu 448 billion) to 53% for the erdf (ecu 11.901 billion). b. a special focus on research and technological innovation one of the characteristics of the current structural funds programming period (1994-1999) is the commission's desire to strengthen coherence between the community's structural and other policies. while the 7th annual report on the structural funds (1995) highlighted the inclusion of environmental concerns in all structural operations, this report describes the operations undertaken for the technological development of the regions. given the wide variety of measures financed by the structural funds, the report covers all the measures and sectors aided by the funds with this objective in mind, notably research and development, the information society and innovation. 1. the context the need for complimentarity between the community's structural and other policies is laid down in article 130b of the ec treaty which states that formulation and implementation of the community's policies and actions and the implementation of the internal market must take into account the objective of strengthened economic and social cohesion, and must in particular seek to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions. in addition, article 130f sets for the community the objective of strengthening the scientific and technological basis of community industry and encouraging it to become more competitive at international level while promoting all the research activities deemed necessary by virtue of other chapters of the treaty. to effect the interaction required by the treaty, when preparing the new programming period the commission adopted guidelines in 1993 in a communication entitled \"cohesion and rtd policy - synergies between research and technological development policy and economic and social cohesion policy\"17. the communication set out the national and regional disparities in living standards, expenditure and staff involved in rtd, the participation rates of the least-favoured regions in both rtd and the cohesion instruments. it also highlighted the significant disparities between the rich and least-favoured regions in terms of rtd indicators: the disparities between the member states in terms of public expenditure on rtd, which ranged from 1 to 13 in 1993, were even greater than the disparities in gdp per inhabitant, which ranged from 1 to 5. the communication also stressed the difficulty the least-favoured regions have in participating in the community's framework programmes on research and development. while observing the primary objectives of each policy, the communication proposed that complimentarity should be increased with a view to making up for the delays in rtd in the least-favoured regions, that account should be taken of economic and social cohesion in the fourth rtd 16 see chapter ii.a. budget implementation. 17 com(93)203 final, 12 may 1993. 168 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) otherwise the same as for 1994-96. objectives 3 and 4 objectives 3 and 4 in belgium are programmed in csfs, each of which is implemented in five operational programmes. this complexity is due to the structure of the belgian state, which consists of a federal government, three communities and three regions, and the authority responsible for each has its own specific powers in the areas covered by objectives 3 and 4 of the esf. fig. v-3: objective 3 - programming 1994-99

close to 100% of the programmed annual instalments, with the result that some projects meeting the selection criteria have had to be rejected for lack of funds. about 70 000 people (outside of hainaut, which is eligible under objective 1) benefited from training, guidance or reintegration measures funded by the esf. this is a remarkable number of beneficiaries in view of the budgetary constraints and the fact that under measures part-financed by the esf priority is given to the most deprived groups (young people without qualifications, older unemployed people, the very long-term unemployed, etc). the programmes give a key role to \"pathways to integration\" and partnership between the different promoters. under this approach, a pathway to integration is designed for each unemployed person. implementation thus requires close cooperation between promoters (public or private) and the public authorities. example of an objective 3 project in belgium: \"cad design\" - an industrial design training project the originality of cad design is that it brings together several partners: the federal ministry of employment, die cefora (training centre of the joint national auxiliary committee for employees), the training and employment fund for employees in the metal manufacturing industry in brabant, die ibffp and a public vocational training institute. the training provides a qualification and lasts for 10 months (approx. 1 600 hours). it makes use of the most powerful computer aids and offers a real opportunity for conversion to job seekers without any prior qualification but with a personal flair for industrial or technical design and an interest in creative project work. the training is designed to enable trainees to take initiatives in a proposed industrial project. the esf is contributing ecu 120 000 per year towards an annual total cost of ecu 300 000. fie. v-4: objective 4 - programming 1994-99 (ecu million \u0142 1996 prices) priorities:

competent authorities resulting from the structure of the belgian state. 1996 must therefore be considered the first year of actual implementation. uptake of esf commitments to belgium are close to one quarter of the total amount initially programmed. it must be recognised that a very long time is needed to implement plans under this new objective. the target of 6 000 employees of smes (outside hainaut) benefiting from a training measure under objective 4 was nevertheless reached in 1996. thanks to the effort made by the belgian authorities to inform the target groups of this instrument and the encouraging number of files newly submitted, the community programmes can now be expected to reach their cruising speed. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-2: programming 1994-99(ecumillion-

granted by both the federal government and by the regions of flanders and wallonia. wallonia is, by contrast, alone in paying compensatory allowances in less-favoured areas. during 1996, wallonia began the task-of recasting its legislation applying community rules, which should be completed in 1997. a similar operation in flanders resulted in commission approval, in december 1996, of an investment and start-up aid scheme. implementation of aid for the processing and marketing of agricultural and forestry products is making good progress in both regions. most projects are innovative and respect the environment. objective 5(a) fisheries , fig. v-s: objective 5(a) fisheries - programming 1994-99 (ecu million): adjustment of fishinc effort (a) other fishing fleet measures (b)

spd for wallonia picked up speed in 1996. the difficulties with the flemish spds were mainly due to technical assistance problems and the search for regional part-fmancing, which was decided on in may 1996 for the agricultural section, so that projects could be launched, but had not yet been settled by the end of the year for the other parts, such as the economy, industry, tourism and social affairs. this explains the delays in financial implementation for the two flemish areas. implementation of the programme in wallonia has gained speed in terms of both financial implementation and actual progress on the ground. the monitoring cornmittee studied the overall situation in the wood industry in order to improve the conditions for granting assistance and the regional authorities held a seminar on integrating training measures in development projects. one of the main subjects which occupied the monitoring committees was the launch of evaluation for all programmes (selection of assessors, definition of terms of reference for evaluation). in addition, the esf assistance under the spds for meetjesland and wallonia was adjusted (for meetjesland unutilised assistance was carried forward and for wallonia the financing tables were adjusted to facilitate management). 3 eligible regions: wallonia, meetsjesland, westhoek. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 171 table

seven interreg programmes. at the end of 1996, the cips for leader had not yet been approved. support for the development of technological potential in belgium: the belgian cips investing most in technological development are the smes and interreg programmes. both the smes programmes support technological innovation as a key to improving the competitiveness of businesses and creating jobs. the programme for wallonia is investing ecu 1.3 million (total cost: ecu 1.8 million) in the creation of a technology activity centre to help firms make best use of research centres, the services provided by universities and regional innovation aid, and to access information and make contact with those operating in research and innovation. the programme also aims to facilitate access to information technology and full utilisation of its potential through the use of databases and shared communications services. the flemish smes programme gives pride of place to assisting and implementing innovation projects and coordinating and developing rtd networks. under interreg ii, ecu 2.5 million (total cost: ecu 5.2 million) are provided for rtd and ecu 0.8 million for communications and data transmission applications (total cost: ecu 1.7 million). the cip for hainaut/nord pas-de-calais/picardy supports economic activity through the development of research and technology and communication projects, and encourages exchanges between scientific centres and centres of excellence. the cip for west-vlaanderen/nord-pas de calais gives priority to strengthening and diversifying training and research potential in the targeted sectors (e.g. technology transfers). the cip for belgium, france and luxembourg supports individual and collective training and technological innovation ; 72 &th annual report on the structural funds (1996) projects (e.g. training networks and infrastructure). in addition, the cips for belgium and the netherlands and for belgium, the netherlands and germany provide for cooperation between businesses and. with research centres and technology transfer as means of stimulating innovation and the modernisation of production methods and products in firms. in the field of communications and telematics, the programme for hainaut/nord-pas de calais/picardy provides for cross-border advanced communications poles and the creation of a vocal, optical and data communication network. the belgium/france/luxembourg programme seeks to develop teleworking and use of data transmission for education and technology development (e.g. databases, multimedia, distance education, etc). in the context of the initiatives concerned with the conversion of industry, one of the main measures under r\u00e9sider ii aims at promoting technology development in li\u00e8ge with a contribution of ecu 2.7 million (total cost: ecu 5.4 million) and, in charleroi and centre, with a contribution of ecu 1.9 million (total cost: ecu 3.7 million). the purpose of the measure is to help research centres and universities with equipment, to help businesses analyse their strengths and weaknesses in terms of rtd and acquire advanced technology with which to modernise their production systems and to encourage the spread of technology. the retex initiative in flanders also supports technology development and training with a view to preserving the textile industry. the horizon section of the employment initiative provides assistance to encourage telecommuting, distance training and computerised interactive learning for the disabled and the most disadvantaged groups (ecu 1.8 million; total cost: ecu 4 million). lastly, the leader programme is contributing ecu 0.2 million (total cost: ecu 0.4 million) to the construction of a communications centre in wallonia and the development of computer facilities, telecommuting and communications as support infrastructure for local production centres. three new community initiative programmes were adopted in 1996, namely: the smes programme for flanders, retex flanders and urban brussels. in addition, allocation of the community initiatives reserve, worth an additional ecu 55.2 million, will allow all the initiatives (except smes) in which belgium participates to be strengthened, with the lion's share going to the new interreg ii c and employment, for which the competent belgian authorities have presented a draft programme to include the new section integra from 1997. the same applies for the new adapt-bis initiative and the strengthening of pesca4. regarding the existing programmes: urban: the projects already approved under the antwerp programme account for ecu 1.6 million of the ecu 2.6 million programmed. a further ecu 1.4 million will be allocated from the reserve, and will be earmarked for a new measure (\"handelspandenbeteid\"). the financial structure of the cip for brussels was adapted to change the contribution of the private partners and the scope of the measures concerning two business centres in brussels. the decision will be finalised during 1997. employment: the two programmes are now well underway. in flanders, 42 projects were selected and commenced in 1996 (19 projects under horizon, 15 projects under now, 8 projects under youthstart), with a total of 1 227 participants (264 for now, 87 for youthstart, 876 for horizon). the promoters are extremely varied, while the measures mostly concern training. in the french and german-speaking communities, 89 projects were approved and launched in 1996 (26 projects under now, 15 under youthstart, 48 under horizon). the themes are varied: 35 training projects, 30 concerning training schemes, 16 concerning job creation and 8 dissemination/information. adapt: under the programme being implemented in flanders, 23 projects were selected in 1995, the great majority of which were launched in 1996 and concern sectors like textiles, electrical engineering, environment, construction, transport and tourism. the emphasis is more on innovation, participation of smes and increasing the requirements as regards the qualifications of employees, and less on technical aspects of adaptation to change. the promoters are fairly diverse (regional vocational training and employment office^ association of independent workers, other training and education establishments, chamber of commerce and provincial government). the 35 projects were approved in the french and german-speaking communities in 1996. the regional priorities are 4 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 173 improving levels of qualification, competitiveness of businesses, the environment and the creation of new jobs. the measure most utilised concerns training (22 projects). r\u00e9sider: the programme for li\u00e8ge is fairly far advanced, with all the allocated appropriations for three measures under the priority concerned with promotion of technological innovation already committed at national level. the programme for hainaut provides for the creation of a start-up fund for smes, for which the implementing arrangements had yet to be brought into line with the commission's communication of july 1995 on financial engineering. these arrangements were worked out by the walloon authorities and accepted by the commission in september 1996. leader: the programmes were not yet ready for adoption in 1996. both programmes for flanders (meetjesland and westhoek) were presented in october 1994 and several amended versions have been submitted, but further adjustments were still needed before they could be adopted by the commission, particularly to avoid any overlapping with the spds for objective 5(b) and to reduce the technical assistance. in the case of wallonia, too, the regional authorities continued in 1996 to prepare their programme proposal on the basis of the commission's comments. the commission is expected to approve the programmes at the beginning of 1997. most of the community initiatives were adopted by the commission during the second half of 1995 and the first half of 1996, so actual implementation commenced during 1996. in almost all cases, community appropriations were committed using the single commitment procedure, so commitments and payments to end beneficiaries began to be booked in 1996, but the sums involved are still fairly small. table v-4: belgium - community initiatives million) 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 (ecu initiative (number of programmess) adapt (2) employment (2) pesca (1) smes (2)

report on the structural funds (1996) 2. denmark 2.1. implementation of assistance by objective in 1996 support for the development of technological potential in the regions of denmark : most of the danish programmes form part of a strategy of supporting the information society, with the aim -thanks to close cooperation between public and private sectors - to encourage access to and exchange of information, stimulate the democratic process, support personal development, to improve transparency and the quality of service in the public sector, to integrate groups excludes from society and to reinforce the international competitiveness of businesses in order to consolidate the social system in denmark. the spds under objective 2 (1994-96) also aim to support technological development as a factor in developing businesses, improving competitiveness and reducing the structural vulnerability of regional economies. for instance, the strategy for north jutland is devoting ecu 38.7 million to rdt (21% of structural fund allocations), the industrial sector (developing new products, technology transfer) and services with high job-intensity, with a high technology content and highly integrated into production processes. improving technology management in firms is another aim. around 60% of the operations being funded deal with the introduction of new technologies and new types of production, and between 5 and 10 new networks are being established to assist knowledge transfers between businesses. the spd for lolland provides support for rtd and the development of r&d infrastructure so as to strengthen the links between research-centre activities and the needs of businesses. support for technological development is also integrated into the operations for implementing other spd priorities (adult training, etc.). in all, in the two objective 2 areas, almost ecu 13 million from the structural funds (23.3% of total community funding) are going into operations supporting rtd. table v-5: denmark \u0142 funding directly linked to technological development in 1994-99 (ecu million) financing by the structural funds 100% objectif 2 total 4m * iwft

areas: lolland, north jutland. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 175 an assessment of the two programmes was made in 1996. this covered both spds and contained a general part dealing with both areas and a part on each separately. in the general part, the assessors gave particular attention to the correspondence between goals, programmes and preliminary conditions in order to identify appropriate indicators. in the part on lolland, the assessment looked at the assistance to existing small businesses as a long-term development strategy and the need to strengthen aid towards improving general conditions in the region. the assessment report shows that, while it is useful to aid existing firms, they cannot create enough new jobs to offset the job losses due to declining production and company closures, so that it is also important to support the setting-up of new businesses. the report also concludes that firms in lolland have a much greater need to improve their general operating conditions than is apparent in their take-up of current aid schemes, especially a need for training and in particular training in the new technologies. firms are having difficulties recruiting graduates and middle management, which suggests a project specifically aimed at training that will also encourage innovative people. finally, it was clear that advisory services to businesses could play a more active role in making firms aware of the assistance available to them. the assessment specific to the north jutland spd concentrated on evaluating the target firms and the support given to large and small businesses. the assessment report concludes that a basis exists for a strategy of internationalisation, since of 2 500 firms that could potentially be exporters only 2 000 are today. the report suggests giving more weight when selecting projects to the growth potential of firms, the relative scale of projects and their payoff rather than the size of businesses themselves. the report also proposes creating a subprogramme aimed at smaller scale projects funded by small businesses. preparation for the 1997-99 programming period preparations for the 1997-99 phase took up the second half of 1996 and covered the same eligible areas. the content of the draft programmes has not changed significantly. the structure of the lolland programme is identical except for an operation concerning support infrastructure which is turned into an operation to assist strategic infrastructure. the same applies to north jutland, except that two priorities for 1994-96 have been run together because of the difficulty of distinguishing between manufacturing and service firms. this will simplify the management of this programme. objectives 3 and 4 fig. v-8: objective 3 -

concentrated on helping participants make contacts with the world of work and on individual counselling and monitoring in accordance with personal plans of action drawn up with the help of public job centres. it is important for the most vulnerable groups that project content should correspond to the needs of the local labour market, personal qualifications, the conditions of a normal working life and the needs of the individual. 1996 also saw the adoption of new legislation to strengthen the administration of the esf, the management of funds, the selection of projects, oversight rules, monitoring, accounting procedures and assessments, as well as the gathering of data for assessments. a new computer system was also installed, part of which will serve the central authorities and part of which will be at regional level. 776 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) fie. v-9: objective 4 - programming 1994-99 (ecu million - 1996 prices) priorities anticipating labour market

since this was a new departure, the danish authorities made considerable efforts to set up the implementing machinery and good progress was made in 1996. the target group for the programme are workers threatened with redundancy who need to be helped to cope with change by vocational training schemes. the programme also sets out to develop new ways of forecasting training needs and improving vocational training systems so as to increase the flexibility of workers in terms of qualifications required. the spd has been extended to cover the period 1997-99, with an additional ecu 25 million in funding. it was essential to continue the strategy already begun because there was little data for assessing the programme adopted in 1994. any other changes that may be needed can be made later in light of the mid-term assessment to be carried out in mid-1997. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-6: programming 1994-99(ecumillion- 1994prices): total mesures 127,0 production marketing 100,3 79%

in eight community initiatives: urban, konver, employment, adapt, smes, pesca, leader and interreg. five community initiative programmes were adopted at national level between 1994 and 1995, and four interreg programmes. the three programmes remaining to be approved, the programmes under the smes initiative and leader and an interreg programme with sweden were adopted in 1996. support for the development of technological potential in den/nark : development of the information society in denmark is a goal in the community initiative programmes under interreg, konver and smes. the interreg programmes shared by denmark and germany are designed to reduce the isolation of the three regions concerned (plammgsraum v and sonderjyllands ami, ostholstein, liibeck and storstroms amt, and kern and fyns amt) and its impact on their economies by stimulating rtd, education and rtd training as well as (he development of small businesses (ecu 2.s million; total volume: ecu 5.7 million). similarly, the cross-border cooperation programme for the baltic (denmark, poland, baltic states) contains measures to support the development of small businesses (e.g. 'baltic house '), training and cooperation in the field of communications and the media (ecu 0.6 million; total volume: ecu 1.3 million - e.g. 'baltic media centre), while the programme between denmark and sweden provides for 6 eligible areas: north jutland, viborg, ringkobing, south jutland, the islands. 18 rthrannual report on the structural funds (1996) framework programme and the importance of rtd and innovation in the development aid provided by the structural funds should be strengthened. this was achieved in practice by significantly increasing the structural fund appropriations for rtd and innovation18. the cohesion dimension was better integrated in the 4th rtd framework programme, most notably in operations 3 (dissemination of the results) and 4 (training and researcher mobility). for example, 1% of each specific rtd framework programme is reserved for operations to disseminate and exploit the results, and an \"innovation programme\" in tandem with the operations under article 10 of the erdf regulation was launched in 1995 to introduce regional innovation and technology transfer strategies (ruts), regional innovation strategies (ris) and regional technology transfer projects (rtt)19. in the case of researcher training and mobility,29% of the applications for study grants come from the objective 1 -6 regions and those same regions account for 26% of the coordinators for euroconferences, while host facilities in the objective 1 regions have increased from 4% in the 3rd rtd framework programme to 15% in the 4th programme. research workers in the objective 1 regions also participated in many of the research projects under the 4th programme since in 1996 40% of projects implementing the rtd framework programmes included at least one participant from an objective 1 region. yet the disparities persist despite this progress, the scientific and technological indicators show that the technology gap between member states and regions is still significant. thus, in the case of rtd expenditure, the disparities between the cohesion countries and the other member states are very great in terms of gross expenditure as a percentage of gdp, private sector involvement and the number of scientists and engineers employed. sources of innovation funding are harder to come by in these member states and there is a significant trade deficit in technology. research and innovation activities in the four member states in question are highly concentrated in just a few regions, usually in and around the capital. rtd - what the report on economic and social cohesion teaches us : the most dynamic and successful laboratories and enterprises are located in the heart of europe in \"islands of innovation\" which host almost 80% of the laboratories involved in international cooperation in rtd and where an interactive network to develop new products and production processes is characteristic. in 10 years the expenditure on rtd as a percentage of gdp has increased from 0.4% to 0.63% in portugal, from 0.34% to 0.6% in greece, 0.8% to 1.24% in ireland. in spain, it increased from 0.48% \u00e0 0.93%. as regards member state participation in the rtd framework programmes, the situation is encouraging in some respects. while the relative position of the member states in terms of expenditure on the 2nd and 3rd rtd framework programmes has not changed, the share of the four cohesion countries has increased from one framework programme to the next. at the same time, the relative position of france, the united kingdom and germany only increased marginally or actually decreased. in qualitative terms, research institutes and public universities continue to be the major participants from objective 1 regions, with little private sector input. new scientific knowledge has nevertheless been obtained and applied through the rapid launch of new products and production processes. small firms find it hard to benefit from the programmes, however, and while the programmes have brought about closer cooperation between partners from the north and south of europe, there is a risk that such closeness will diminish the research in terms of its relevance to the specific economic and industrial needs of the least-favoured the cohesion regions are much slower in adapting to the information society which involves in the first place introducing a high-performance telecommunications system. there is less access to 18 see below. 19 see chapter i.b.2. innovative actions and technical assistance 178 8th annuut report on the structural funds (1996) special measures to promote new technologies in the context of priorities dedicated to developing industry, the media, rtd and tertiary education. the konver programme focuses on new technologies as a way of strengthening the competitiveness of the regions by developing human resources and management skills in firms, especially through business advisory services, knowledge development and connection of firms to advanced communications networks. finally, the sme programme is involved with technological development under the voucher system ('service ticket ') where there is a need to ensure the continuity and competitiveness of firms and the creation of jobs. three new community initiative programmes were adopted in 1996. the sme programme was adopted in march 1996 and covers areas eligible under objectives 2 and 5(b). this means that the monitoring cornmittee is the same as for the spds under these objectives. this programme is the extension of an existing national programme of vouchers ('service ticket') for business start-ups designed to provide new entrepreneurs with '\u00e0 la carte' access to advisory services and training in conjunction with drawing up a business plan. another programme adopted in april 1996 is the denmark-sweden interreg programme. denmark is now involved in five interreg programmes, three with germany, one with the baltic region and one with sweden, the five programmes are running well. under interreg ii c (ecu 4 million), denmark has started to prepare two programmes with neighbouring countries, one in the north sea area and one in the baltic. finally, the leader programme was adopted in june 1996. this is aimed at safeguarding thriving rural communities by stopping the drift away from the land and attracting new residents, raising skills and protecting and improving the environment. to make the programme as effective as possible, the schemes will cover only half the areas eligible under objective 5(b). additional funding allocated from the reserve for the community initiatives came to ecu 13.5 million. this money will be used to reinforce the initiatives adapt, employment, leader, and above all pesca as well as the new strand c under interreg ii. among programmes already running, the urban programme involving the city of \u00e2lborg (objective 2, north jutland), which shares the monitoring committee for the spd under objective 2, saw work start in 1996 on setting up the centre for sustainable urban development. the konver programme, due to run from 1995 to 1997 to assist karup (jutland) and copenhagen, has been implemented on schedule. this programme has not received additional funding from the reserve for community initiatives and so will not continue beyond 1997. the employment and adapt programmes saw projects coming on stream in the first half of 1996. there are 42 adapt projects and 30 under the employment initiative (8 under youthstart, 15 under horizon and 7 under now), the sponsors are largely traditional institutions, except for the horizon projects which are being running mainly by ngos. the commonest topics are business start-ups by women, teaching information technology skills to the handicapped, the creation of bridges for passing from school to occupational training, support for small businesses and the setting-up of job-sharing schemes, a specifically danish approach. few projects under pesca terminated in 1996, but 27% of the budget has already been allocated to individual projects and at the end of 1996 the commission decided to commit the whole of the assistance for 1994-99 in a single decision. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 179 table v-8: denmark - community initiatives - 1996 in the context of

assistance hy objective in 1996 support for the development of technological potential in the regions of germany: objective 1 : technological development is an important element in the strategy for the development and conversion of the new german lander, with 4.2% of community funding being spent on research, technological development and innovation.. the aim of the r&d and innovation priority is to increase both the number and the quality of staff in r&d establishments through initial and continuing training measures so as to provide support for the development of businesses producing products and using production processes requiring technological know-how. the erdf contribution to this priority accounts for 7% of total erdf appropriations for the csf. these measures are implemented under the ops for the economic development of each land' under an r&d and innovation priority. they cover investment in research departments and industrial laboratories, development and design advice, aid for businesses involved in rtd and investments in rtd infrastructure and innovation centres. they also provide support for measures to improve cooperation between businesses in developing products and processes, the modernisation of information and communications technology and the'development of technological advice services. in addition to this priority, the csf also supports rtd in businesses through investments in technology, the promotion of innovation centres and the development of joint training centres for businesses. \u0142 example of a project financed in saxony: aid has been granted to a technology business \"incubator\" in the landkreis riesa-grofihain. the technology centre is basically involved in renewable energy and laser-treatment of raw materials for which it can provide demonstrations of cutting and welding of metals. the centre is working with the fraunhofer-lnstitut (specialising in solar energy systems) in freiburg to produce a fuel cell. businesses are also provided with advice and training. the eligible investment amounts to around ecu 250 000, of which ecu 150 000 is being supplied by the erdf. objective 2 (1994-1996): all the spds include measures to support technological development, principally rtd (20.7% of community appropriations), either in the form of a priority devoted exclusively to this objective or under the spd s other priorities: \u0142 lower saxony: support is provided under one priority for r&d in businesses and innovation in products and processes by promoting cooperation between businesses and research and training establishments (ecu3.5 million; total cost: ecus.5 million), and. under another priority, for continuing scientific training in applied technology (laser, tourism, quality control in the construction industry; ecu 0.5 million; total cost: ecu 1.1 million), and finally, as part of measures to protect the environment, aid is given for technology designed to reduce, recycle and treat sewage and waste, air-, water- and soil- purification technology, biotechnology and biodegradable materials. example of a project funded in lower saxony: erdf aid has been granted for a project to develop a continuous electrostatic filter, headed by the \"fachhochschule\" in braundschweig-wolfenbiittel. without this aid, the project could not have gone ahead. this new technology-, which enables a high degree of powder recycling, has the potential for widespread use in surface treatment. a patent has already been granted. \u0142 saarland : two specific priorities, one for research and technology providing for the development of a science park and the promotion of the work of research establishments and the application of the results of their work in smes (ecu 3.9 million; total cost: ecu 9.3 million) and the other concerning the transfer of technology and know-how and providing support for bodies involved in technology transfer and innovation advice (ecu 3.3 million, total cost: ecu 14.4 million). in addition to these priorities, the spd provides support for improving research, scientific and technological capacities and improving qualifications to satisfy the requirements of the labour market. \u0142 although the other spds do not contain specific technological development priorities, they do not ignore the issue: in order to improve the environment for smes, they promote technological development (bavaria and rhineland-palatinate) ; innovation by setting up risk-capital funds for the introduction of new technology and providing cash-flow support for smes concerned with technology (bremen), the creation or extension of technology infrastructures, technology parks and other mecklenburgrvvestcrn pomerania: ecu 71.6 million (total cost: ecu 457 million); brandenburg: ecu 1 14.4 million (total cost: ecu 259.3 million); saxony-anhalt: ecu 73.1 million (total cost: ecu 225.7 million); saxony: ecu 207.8 million (total cost: ecu 390.1 million); thuringia: ecu 38.9 million (total cost: ecu 145.1 million); eastern berlin: ecu 61.8 million (total cost: ecu 111.3 million). 8th annual report on the structural funds (19&6) 181 installations (bavaria and north rhine-westphalia) and the development of service and advice providers, particularly in the field of technology transfer (bremen, hesse and north rhine-westphalia). in additionnas part of environmental protection measures, they promote innovation, technology transfers and the adjustment of manufacturing procedures to environmental requirements (west berlin) and the use of environmentally friendly technology and services (bremen). finally, some of these spds stress the need to improve qualifications in the fields of research, science and technology and advice services on continuous training (bavaria, hesse and schleswig-holstein). examples of projects financed between 1994 and 1996: hesse: the erdf provided support for setting up the \"kassel business incubator\" in the former hindenburg barracks, promoting the creation of new technology-oriented businesses. the centre provides a wide range of advice and is in close contact with regional r&d bodies with the aim of improving technology transfers. synergy is sought between the business incubator and its environment, the objective being to strengthen existing businesses in the region and to attract more. this project provides an example of the structural regeneration of former military land it involves a total investment of ecu 6.5 million, of which ecu 2.3 million is provided under the objective 2 spd. north rhine-westphalia: eu rom at gmbh, a research establishment specialising in innovative materials and manufacturing processes, heat-resistant raw materials and surface-treatment technology, receives aid directed essentially towards the development of new technology. euromat makes available its results to businesses which do not have their own research facilities. the work essentially involves the development of new materials for new uses, raw materials with new properties and surface-treatment technology. support for these technology-transfer measures amounts to more than ecu 4.3 million. in total, 4,5% of structural fund appropriations in germany are to support technological development (objectives 1, 2 and 5(b)). table v-9: germany - funding directly linked to

a single op). the csf is providing ecu 13.640 billion at 1994 prices, which represents ecu 13.920 billion at 1996 prices. not all the decisions resulting from this indexation were adopted in 1996 but most of the programmes benefiting from erdf funding were amended during the year. the extra amount after indexation for thuringia, ecu 38.8 million, was devoted to the 'infrastructure' priority, with pai>financing provided exclusively by the land. for berlin, the amount resulting from indexation (ecu 14 million) will be used to strengthen all the development priorities financed by the erdf. in mecklenburg-western pomerania, the appropriations resulting from indexation, i.e. ecu 16.3 million, were added to the funds available for the erdf-dominated op. in saxony, the erdf-dominated op was subject to three amendments, including indexation, permitting erdf appropriations to be increased by ecu 3.2 million (bringing them to ecu 2.1 billion at 1996 prices). in saxony-anhalt, unused 1995 esf appropriations were transferred to the 1996-99 period and the amount of ecu 66.3 million resulting from indexation has not yet been allocated. this is also the case for brandenburg (ecu 1.7 million). implementation of the csf priorities is already bringing concrete results. the principal aim of the priority relating to productive investments and additional investments in infrastructure is the creation of branches, subsidiaries and new businesses, the development of industrial and craft sites, local roads and technology centres. by the end of 1996, aid had been granted to more than 4 000 projects under this priority and some 38 000 jobs had been created and around 90 000 maintained. for example, in thuringia, aid was granted for the creation of 56 craft areas, 28 tourist facilities, 27 waste-water treatment plants, 13 cultural establishments, two road projects and a technology centre. note should also be taken of the extension of an electronic-coupler production facility in wismar (mecklenburg-western pomerania). technical restructuring and an increase in capacity allowed the number of permanent employees torje increased by 170. in berlin, aid was granted for a major project involving the rationalisation and modernisation of the production facilities of a company specialising in electrical engineering, permitting the creation of 200 jobs. table v-10:

operations under the sme priority are intended to stimulate investment in and make available services to smes. the priority is in two parts, the first concerning productive investments (investments relating to the setting up of smes, growth, rationalisation and conversion) and the second principally concerning services to smes (creation and operation of infrastructures with direct economic benefits, the provision of shared premises and services in technology centres, creation of vocational training structures, mobilisation of local development potential, guarantees, aid for market 9 a total of ecu 119.5 million was paid under the 1991-93 csf for the new lander (ecu 42.6 million from the erdf, ecu 52.2 million from the esf, ecu 24.5 million from the eaggf and ecu 0.2 million of fisheries appropriations). the erdf payments concern only mecklenburg-western pomerania (ecu 10.9 million) and saxony (ecu 31.6 million) and, of the ecu 1 567 billion of erdf appropriations available under the 1991-93 csf, ecu 1 479 billion or 95% has been paid. the final reports on mecklenburg-western pomerania, saxony and saxony-anhalt were presented in 1996. an extension of the payment deadline to 31 december 1996 was granted for eastern berlin, thuringia and brandenburg. this extension was required because of administrative problems, continuing uncertainty regarding property and investment delays. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 183 access and business management). by the end of 1996, around 10 000 projects had received aid under this priority, creating some 50 000 jobs and maintaining around 84 000 more. for example, in saxony-anhalt, the erdf granted aid of more than ecu 1.3 million to \"dts systemoberfl\u00e0che\", a company specialising in veneering and mechanical polishing for the wood and furniture industry, which has developed a patented material (\"elesgo film\"). twelve permanent jobs should be created. table v-ll: implementation of the \"sme\"

saarland, rhineland-palatinate, north rhine-westphalia and berlin requested a postponement of the payment deadline to 31 december 1996. the delays were due to unforeseen difficulties during the final phase of implementation of the projects concerned (the withdrawal of a number of private investors in berlin, difficulties caused by high levels of soil contamination in rhineland-palatinate, appeals against projects in saarland, etc.). 12 the transfers for each of the programmes are as follows: bavaria, ecu 2.5 million (17% of the original assistance); berlin, ecu 5.2 million (3%); hesse, ecu 5 million (23%); north rhine-westphalia, ecu 26.1 million (7%); saarland. ecu 1.2 million (2%). 8th annual report on the structural fundi (1996) 185 was carried over to 1995 and 1996 and the appropriations reallocated to infrastructure with a direct economic impact). the allocation of appropriations between the various operations in the north rhine-westphalia spd was reviewed and the text of the provisions on technical assistance slightly amended. a number of other amendments were also made: in rhineland-palatinate, development operations in various zones were strengthened because a measure to promote tourism could not be completed in the time planned; in saarland, a new measure to promote the creation of new teleservice businesses was planned; in schleswig-holstein, indexation was carried out to strengthen the kiel-horn project. for those programmes receiving a community contribution of more than ecu 40 million, 1996 saw the preparation and commencement of the mid-term reviews (specifications, tendering procedure, methods). the review is being carried out by outside experts who should complete their evaluation reports and the calculation of the basic data for the programmes of lesser importance (hesse, schleswig-holstein, bavaria and rhineland-palatinate) in april 1997. work was also continued to organise monitoring with the establishment of the monitoring subcommittees for those spds receiving the largest community contributions, i.e. more than ecu 40 million. this involves the programmes for berlin, bremen, lower saxony, north rhine-westphalia and saarland. the new committees began work during the year and contributed to the drafting of the new programming documents for the 1997-99 period. preparation of the 1997-99 programming period as part of the preparations for the 1997-99 programming period, the new development plans which will serve as the basis for negotiations between the commission and the federal government and the lander were submitted to the commission in may 1996 against a 4 background which remains unchanged from that prevailing during the 1994-96 programming period. the commission is due to adopt decisions on the new programmes in the spring of 1997. objectives 3 and 4 fie. v-14: objective 3 - proerammine 1994-99 (ecu million -1996 prices) priority vocational integration of jobless threatened with lone-term unemployment (a) vocational integration of young people seeking work (b) integration of peodle threatened with exclusion (c) eaual opportunities for b77men and women (d) technical assjsfim\u00e7\u00e7 wj pilot project?

illustrated by the fact that half the appropriations for the 1994-99 period had been committed by the end of 1996. which is a positive result if account is taken of the fact that the ops were only adopted at the end of 1994 and most of them did not get up to speed until the second half of 1995. applications under the afg-plus federal op, which complements the \"employment support act\" (arbeitsf\u00f4rderungsgesetz - afg), were much higher than expected. the most successful measure was the provision of training to those ineligible under the afg, principally women, the measure therefore helping to improve equality of opportunity. the heavy demand led to a reduction in the measures planned for handicapped people and discussions were opened between the commission and the german authorities to find a way of maintaining these measures without damaging the afg-plus programme. non-profit-making temporary-employment agencies have now been set up under the regional ops. these agencies place the long-term unemployed in businesses on fixed-term contracts with the aim of then getting the businesses to employ them on permanent contracts. during periods when the workers are without a contract, they can undertake training so as to improve their chances of finding permanent work. this approach is a 186 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996)) sort of pathway to employment, offering work experience in a company 'plus training. training requirements can be assessed during the period of work experience and businesses can recruit workers who fulfil their requirements. the monitoring committee again looked the question of employment policy, particularly the extent to which esf assistance under objective 3 reflects community employment policy (discussions centred in particular on job creation and improving the employability of workers). finally, the mid-term review was begun with the selection by invitation to tender of twelve assessors for each op and an assessor responsible for the csf and coordination of the other twelve assessments. the draft report is expected to be ready by mid-1997. fie. v- 15: objective 4 - programming

and one federal programme. although several lander overcame the start-up problems encountered in 1995, others, as well as the federal authorities, required more time to set up the innovative training courses required by the spd. the use of funding improved over the year. furthermore, the programme was extended in may 1996 to cover the period 1994-99 with contributions of ecu 265.3 million from the esf, ecu 87 million from the national budget, ecu 144 million from the lander and ecu 151.8 million from the private sector. the measures concerned were not changed. the severe restrictions on public finances are making it increasingly difficult to meet the national part-financing laid down in the spd, but the national authorities and the commission took steps to increase the flexibility of financing structures in order to remedy the situation. one very positive aspect is that businesses are often deciding to participate in the programme after obtaining good results with the initial projects. finally, the mid-term review of the spd could result in reprogramming to ensure the programme's success. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-12: prorrammine 1994-99 (ecu million - 1996 prices

868.2 million. two-thirds of that amount are accounted for by compensatory payments in less-favoured areas, which cover 51% of the utilised agricultural area. around 220 000 farmers received such aid in 1994, slightly down on the previous year. a total of ecu 113 million is earmarked for young farmers. investment aid represents 15% of the total and was paid to 1 800 farms in 1994, with a large percentage going to bavaria, schleswig-holstein and lower saxony. given the expiry on 1 january 1997 of article 38 of regulation (eec) no 2328/91 laying down special conditions for investment aid in the new lander, uniform conditions for the old and the new lander were adopted at the end of 1996 for the german agricultural investment programme (agrarinvestitionsforderprogramm 1997-2000), in order to ensure uniform application throughout the country. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 187 implementation of the ten spds relating to the processing and marketing of products accelerated after initial delays. by the end of 1996, approximately 40% of the community contribution had been committed for approved projects. aid is concentrated in the fruit and vegetables, meat,

evaluation of the three programmes implemented during the 1989-93 period, the use of national aid schemes as a source of national part-financing was again very effective in permitting rapid, problem-free implementation in 1996. as regards monitoring of the programmes, in addition to examining the annual progress reports, for two spds, the monitoring committees amended the national aid schemes in order to adjust the programmes in line with the rhythm of implementation and, for the spds as a whole, laid down the guidelines for the mid-term review of the programmes. an initial report on this phase of implementation was drafted by the assessors at the end of 1996 and the final reports are expected in april 1997. 13 eligible areas: baden-wiirttemburg. north rhine-westphalia,

technological change the pace of technological change has increased in recent years and the community and its least-favoured regions are not always equipped to cope with it. the white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment highlighted the factors and conditions needed to increase competitiveness on world markets in a time of increased economic, social and technological change. on the one hand, innovation must no longer be seen as a linear process, but as the result of numerous interactions between research laboratories and enterprises either developing or using new technology. the demand for technology to meet new and increasing needs brings this interaction about. innovation itself takes several forms and is geared as much to the products as to an enterprise's production processes and structure. in this context priority should be given to investing in intangibles in the enterprises themselves (smes in particular) and to balancing the demand for technology with supply (especially at regional level). research and development must thus be extended through the dissemination of results and technology transfer, and be boosted by the need to satisfy new social needs (including, for example, the environment, health, biotechnology, culture). on the other hand, the development of the information society is bringing about an upheaval in the way enterprises are organised, and will shortly do the same to lifestyles and working practices. a highly sophisticated ability to adjust will be required in response, with accompanying measures needed at several levels, all interlinked. improvements to basic telecommunications services and infrastructure are needed to complete the european communications networks serving the entire community territory. it is also necessary however to spread the use of the new information and communication technologies, to smes in particular, and to encourage in this regard technological awareness and rtd in this field. the changes will be accepted only if the users of the new information and communications technologies are sufficiently trained. there is thus a need to improve training for the users and the public at large by making teaching and training relevant, and for the producers of these technologies through training and vocational retraining. 2,\u00b0 for more information see in particular: \"\"european

germany is participating in all the community initiatives with the exception of regis. most of the community initiative programmes (cips) were approved by the commission in 1995. at the end of that year, a total of 19 programmes were still to be approved for leader, urban, rechar, r\u00e9sider, retex, smes and konver plus one interreg cip. these programmes were approved in 1996 (2 leader, 6 smes, 1 rechar, 3 konver, 1 r\u00e9sider, 1 retex, 2 urban, and 1 interreg in cooperation with austria), bringing the number of cips being implemented in germany to 83 and the number of interreg cips to 18. support for the development of technological potential in germany: most of the programmes under the smes initiative give priority to the technological development of smes. in north rhine-westphalia, ecu 2.1 million (total cost: ecu 13 million) is earmarked for promoting technology and innovation, in bavaria, ecu 3.7 million (total cost ecu 10.6 million) for promoting quality and innovation in smes and, in schleswig-holstein, ecu0.7million (total cost ecu 1.4million) for innovative businesses. in the new lander, the smes cips are also making a large contribution to job creation, with the saxony-anhalt programme providing ecu 4.9 million (total cost ecu 11 million) for r&d in distance working, the creation of networks and the utilisation of patents, while the saxony cip provides ecu 16.6 million (total cost ecu 47.2 million) to promote the introduction of new technology. as regards the initiatives relating to industrial conversion, the konver programmes aim to give priority to technological development as a means of promoting economic diversification. most of these programmes involve conversion from military to civilian technology (examples: bavaria, saarland, recycling of cars and production of tanker lorries; schleswig-holstein, bremen, institute of production engineering), support for innovation and technology transfer (saxony-anhalt, bremen and brandenburg) and cooperation between scientific workers at european level (bremen). from the point of view of financing, ecu 2.8 million (total cost ecu 4.3 million) and ecu 1.4 million (total cost ecu 2.9 million) are provided for implementation of the measures in the saxony-anhalt and bremen programmes respectively. the r\u00e9sider programme in brandenburg is supporting education and training measures in the fields of innovative environmental and infrastructure technology. the retex cips also give priority to technological development (in saxony, ecu 12.6 million out of a total of ecu 33.5 million is being granted for supporting r&d in businesses and technology centres and, in thuringia, ecu 3.1 million out of a total of ecu 8.2 million is being provided for the transfer and introduction of new technology through improving know-how in businesses and developing cooperation. germany and denmark are cooperating under interreg to solve the problems caused by poor communications in three regions (planungsraum v and sonderjyllands amt, ostholstein, lubeck and storstroms amt. and kern and fyns amt) and the consequences for the economies of those regions.14. the cips covering germany and luxembourg (euroregio), france (saarland, lorraine, palatinate) and poland (mecklenburg- western pomerania) give priority to rtd and technology transfers. that covering france and switzerland (upper rhine) is providing ecu 2.5 million (total cost ecu 4.9 million) to stimulate r&d and develop telecommunications. ___________ 14 see chapter v.2. denmark. / 90 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996)) all the cips have now been approved by the commission and are now in the initial stage. in 1996, 16 new cips were approved, including five in brandenburg. the largest group of approved programmes (a total of six) come under the smes initiative and involve a total of ecu 26.1 million from the structural funds. five of these programmes concern the old ijinder, the sixth being in one of the new lander. the brandenburg cip concentrates on technical measures and measures relating to business management in addition to traditional investment support. in lower saxony, the cip gives priority to quality guarantees and the transfer of intangibles. operations in schleswig-holstein relate to quality management and the search for markets for innovative products. under the slogan \"mining region to modem industrial region\", the new rechar programme in brandenburg provides support for operations to create and maintain jobs while improving the environment and economic structures. in addition, two urban programmes, for saarbriicken and hesse, have been approved, the latter aiming to renovate a district of 1.1 km2 with a population of around 5 000 to increase its attractiveness and turn it into a meeting place. it is planned inter alia to open a youth and leisure centre in a former coffee-roasting factory and to lay out 10 000 m2 of green areas. a number of industrial conversion programmes have also been approved, including three konver programmes, for baden-wurttemburg, saxony and brandenburg. the programme for brandenburg aims, in particular, to put to economic use and exploit the economic potential of buildings currently undergoing conversion in the region. the main objectives of the programme in saxony are the renovation of old buildings and land formerly used by troops of the cis and the promotion of their rational use by the municipalities concerned (installation or creation of businesses). the r\u00e9sider programme in brandenburg involves operations relating to infrastructures, environmental resources and human resources. operations such as the renovation of old factory buildings with the aim of putting them to economic use and cooperation between businesses and research centres should lead to the creation of permanent jobs. the retex cip in brandenburg also aims to increase economic diversification by encouraging inter alia cooperation between businesses in marketing and purchasing. the commission approved the final leader programme, for schleswig-holstein. the bottom-up approach adopted for this initiative has been found to be most suitable for german rural areas, in both the old and the new lander. the local groups have drafted a large number of promising projects and, in the old lander, 60 local action groups (lags) and 15 other collective bodies have been set up. the conference on leader ii held in germany allowed a fruitful exchange of views between local groups and the various official bodies concerned. progress on implementation varies from one land to another but, overall, progress is in line with forecasts. the complexity of administrative procedures caused start-up difficulties with the pesca programme. given the needs of the areas dependent on fishing and the high number of applications received, progress can reasonably be expected in the near future. the programme was twice amended in 1996: a single commitment was agreed and appropriations were concentrated by means of a transfer from the esf to the erdf and the fifg. as regards the initiatives relating to human resources, the implementation of which has been to a large extent regionalised, with the lander responsible for 85% of the available funding (15% is intended for funding supra-regional projects by the federal government), projects were selected following the first calls for submissions. under the employment initiative, 242 projects were selected, including 24 at federal level (73 for now, 120 for horizon and 49 for youthstart). the main focus of the projects under the three strands of the initiative is training. emphasis is also placed on developing local partnerships and cooperation with businesses to provide work experience. one of the major themes of the now projects is the creation of businesses by women. under youthstart, a number of projects aim to prepare young people for vocational training. horizon places the stress on the whole series of stages leading to employment. a total of 220 projects were selected under the adapt initiative, including 17 at federal level. as under the employment initiative, emphasis is placed on training activities. however, a number of projects concentrate on analysing the problems caused to businesses, certain professions and certain regions by economic developments. the range of activities is verv wide, including, for example, management skills in smes, strategies for th\u00e9 development of 8th annual report mi the structural funds (1996) 191 businesses by the conquest of new markets or the development of new* products, job creation, particularly through the introduction of new technology and new ways of organising work and the creation of a network of those involved in the regional labour market in order to stimulate employment. a number of programmes were adjusted. in certain cases this involved reprograrriming (for example, new financial allocation between priorities, redefinition of eligible measures) but in most cases the reason was to allocate amounts resulting from indexation15. in total, the amount resulting from indexation at 1996 prices is almost ecu 25 million for the initiatives concerned, i.e. interreg, konver, r\u00e9sider, smes, rechar, urban and retex. in addition, ecu 317.7 million was allocated to germany as a reserve. these additional appropriations will be allocated to konver (more than one third), interreg and employment and will permit the launching of new urban programmes (zwickau and kiel) and an increase in funding for the interreg iic programmes16. table v-14: germany - community initiatives - 1996 in the context of programming for

i.b.i. community initiatives. 192 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 4. greece support for the development of technological potential in greece-support for technological development is a key factor in the development strategy of the greek csf (accounting for 4.8% of community appropriations). telecommunications and data transmission applications, which open up access for the information society in greece, along with rtd, form part of all csf priorities, i.e. integrating the national territory through the development of major infrastructure: improving living conditions: developing the economic base; developing human resources and fostering employment; and reducing regional disparities and improving communications in island areas through 13 regional programmes. in the first instance, improving and modernising telecommunications (under the csf, ecu 250.7 million; total cost: ecu 452.2 million) is planned as a means of reducing the remoteness of certain areas. a multiregional op for telecommunications (ecu 203.7 million; total cost: ecu 383.8 million) follows on from the previous programming period (crash programme, 1992-93). despite encouraging results, the quality of the network was still poor at the end of 1993 (the rate of line breakdowns was the highest in the community, waiting time for new lines was exceptionally long), and the network was the least digitised in the union, reflecting the lowest level of per capita investment in the european union. the telecommunications op not only envisages improving infrastructure (raising the level of digitisation of the network to 90% and speeding up the introduction of advanced technologies - rnis, atm - and pilot services), but encouraging enterprises to use the new technologies through training schemes, modern management methods and stimulating the creation of new services by the market. in addition to this multiregional op, improving basic communications and infrastructure networks generally is an aim of most regional ops (the p\u00e9loponn\u00e8se, mainland greece, ionian islands, etc.) and especially of those whose main strategy is to develop tourism (northern aegean, southern aegean, etc.). while there is no op specifically aimed at developing data transmission applications, a number of multiregional ops provide support for them in the context of improving living conditions (health and insurance) and developing human resources (education and public administration). for example, one of the main measures under the health op is to develop an it system for health authorities and modernise scientific infrastructure and equipment (distance medicine). the education op too allocates ecu 40.5 million (total cost: ecu 54 million) to linking universities, technical colleges and the education ministry network; the op for the modernisation of the public administration, with a budget of ecu 117.5 million (total cost: ecu 235 million), seeks to improve the management of human resources and the effectiveness of officials in the taxation, customs, finance and budget ministries, through the introduction of new technologies (data transmission networks, major information systems, etc.) and management techniques. rtd, however, receives the bulk of the financial support. the csf strategy is to enhance greece's technical and economic capability, capitalising on the foundations laid down earlier by the first op in relation to rtd and by the stride initiative and the community research programmes. the rtd sub-priority is the subject of a multiregional op with an allocation of ecu 316.2 million (total cost: ecu 579.1 million). of all the areas of assistance covered by the programme, technology transfer and innovation, (stepping up technology transfer through the purchase of licences, small industrial research projects, developing existing technology parks, improving information networks) is the sector receiving the most support. funding is allocated in descending order to: support for rtd in highly profitable productive sectors (biotechnology, new materials, etc) requiring close cooperation between production units and scientists and technological operators; rethinking and expanding research infrastructure; refreshing human potential by updating researchers' skills, training new researchers in advanced technologies and providing training for technicians and administrators in rtd and innovation. part of the rtd programme, with an allocation of ecu 7 million, is devoted also to developing the universities' and research centres' network and disseminating research results (data bases, multimedia bases, etc.). support for rtd is planned also at regional level: \u0142 central macedonia (one of the few regions of greece enjoying a comparative advantage in view of the presence of educational and research establishments) : developing post-university study programmes, improving the infrastructure of these establishments (building new accommodation and laboratories), and developing links between research programmes and the productive sector (aid for small businesses to manufacture innovative products, patent applications and the transfer of new technology in cooperation with the universities and technical institutes); \u0142 similar arrangements are made for rtd and innovation in crete (another region with high rtd potential): ecu 34.2 million (total cost: ecu 56.5 million); \u0142 western greece: developing the infrastructure of the university of patras and the

and mou (management organisation unit) were set up to improve the managerial capabilities of the regions and ministries. the use of project data sheets as a programming tool was extended to all the csf programmes and the establishment of special agencies for implementing major projects continued (egnatia s.a. for the east-west trunk road, ergose for rail projects, kttmatologio s.a. for the land registry). all these agencies are expected to be fully operational in 1997, making it possible for major projects to be implemented effectively and thus improve financial implementation on the ground. in addition, the greek authorities have decided to finance major transport projects (especially road transport) using the system of concessions. this should help attract private capital and make it possible for new sections of road to be built where the public funds available (from national and community sources) have been insufficient to date to guarantee their completion. a new programme was adopted in 1996, the technical assistance op, comprising essentially the mou (management organisation unit) measures, on which preparations began in 1996, along with an information and public awareness plan under the csf, and finally technical assistance measures for the modernisation of the agencies and public enterprises. turning to programmes already implemented, the national railways and telecommunications ops, and the regional ops for western macedonia and western greece, were given additional funding ; 94 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) through indexation of the erdf appropriations and, together with the technical assistance and urban development ops, underwent financial reprogramming. adjustments to the financing plans for these programmes were made to bring them into line with local conditions. a more thorough (midterm) review of all programmes based on their implementation and the findings of the available evaluations is to start in autumn 1997. implementation of the national agriculture op is very satisfactory, as a result mainly of the objective 5(a) measures, particularly those assisting mountain and less-favoured areas and forestry measures. a large number of projects for the processing and marketing of agricultural products were approved too. to meet new priorities in the op, part of the indexing was allocated to it. the 1997 instalment was already committed in 1996 and the first advance paid. a number of low-cost innovative measures under the op are having greater difficulty in getting started, for example the introduction of a geographical system for the combined operation of data-processing systems (gis) for uniform and integrated data management. progress in implementing the rural development component of the regional ops, despite an improvement in 1996, has again been uneven between ops, and the original delays have been only partly made up. some ops have been proceeding very satisfactorily (thessaly, southern aegean, crete, eastern macedonia and thrace), unlike others which have failed to make up all the previous delays (epirus, mainland greece, northern aegean). the remaining ops fall between the two. the fisheries and aquaculture op has given rise to reprogramming, the inclusion of the 1995 deflator (ecu 1.8 million), the adoption of a study on fishery products processing/marketing sectors, the adoption of a specific measure for the measurement of several fishing vessels, and the introduction of a programme manager. progress at the end of 1996 on the fleet sub-programme is satisfactory, while the other two sub-programmes covering the processing/marketing of fishery products and aquaculture respectively are lagging well behind. commitments indicate, however, that the situation will improve in 1997 in view of the time needed to carry out the measures. generally speaking, 1996 has been a turning point in the successful implementation of the csf in greece. improvements in the main macro-economic indicators have resulted in a resumption of private investment. in particular, private investment under the industry and services op is substantially up on 1995, and the implementation of major projects through the system of concessions permitting private capital holdings is also on the right track. this, combined with significant improvements in the implementation arrangements, is creating satisfactory conditions for the success of the csf in greece both in terms of local take-up and of impact on the macro-economic indicators and in generating and maintaining sustainable jobs. the greek authorities have provided public investment funds for 1997 which are substantially up on 1996 at a difficult time of declining public deficits. this should ensure national part-financing for csf operations, and a high level of uptake in 1997 and the making up of some of the delays registered in the period 1994-96. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 as regards the financial implementation of its csf, greece reached the average for the objective 1 countries at the end of 1996. taking into account erdf commitment applications submitted by the greek authorities in december 1996 which were not implemented that year owing to lack of appropriations, the situation regarding the structural funds as a whole is as follows: appropriations committed at the end of 1996 represent 46% of those programmed, and appropriations paid represent 32% of total aid (or 69% of appropriations committed). implementation in relation to the erdf and the eaggf is further advanced even than under the csf programming. eaggf appropriations for the national agricultural programme committed up to the end of 1996 represent 60% of total aid for the period 1994-99, and those paid represent 49%. turning to rural development, in all for the 13 ops, eaggf appropriations committed to the end of 1996 represent 44% of the aid and those paid account for 29%. 8th annual report un the structural funds (1996) 195 progress on the ground, moreover, is satisfactory with 71 % of programmed expenditure implemented at the end of 1996 for all funds (73% for 1996 only). for the reasons set out above, this satisfactory rate of implementation should gather pace in 1997. table v-16: greece - assistance by objective million) 1996 in the context of programming for

greece participates in all the initiatives other than regis, and all the cips (one per initiative) were adopted in 1994 and 1995. this means 10 programmes implemented at national level therefore, to which should be added 3 interreg cips (two regen and one for cross-border cooperation). support for the development of technological potential in greece: the funding from the greek cips to technological development is much less than under the objective i programmes. the only initiatives having a direct bearing in this area are smes and interreg. smes has earmarked. ecu2.7 million (total cost: ecu6.7million) for the development of data transmission applications to improve the international competitiveness of greek small businesses. the interreg external borders cip has set aside ecu 8 million (total cost: ecu 16.5 million) to encourage cross-border cooperation between greece, albania and bulgaria on basic telecommunications infrastructure. under the adapt programme a data network and data bases are to be developed covering jobs, and the employment initiative proposes the use of distance training, telecommuting and multimedia centres by young people and other disadvantaged groups. among the industrial restructuring initiatives, konver supports the development of an electronic network to regenerate small businesses dependent on the defence sector. preparations for the implementation of the smes, r\u00e9sider, rechar and urban cips took place in 1996 while retex and interreg-regen gas are proceeding at a normal pace. the regen programme for a cable between greece and italy has run into problems involving social acceptance by the italian local authorities on environmental grounds. implementation of the interreg-external frontiers programme was well under way but has come to a standstill on account of the political and social situation in neighbouring countries (bulgaria and especially albania). the interreg greece-italy initiative is to be approved in 1997, as should interreg ii c (drought, flooding and cooperation on regional planning). the smes and regen gas cips have undergone financial reprogramming and benefited from indexation, and the agricultural component has been incorporated in the interreg-extemal frontiers cip. in the case of leader h, 1996 was the year in which final evaluation was made of the revised financing plans of the various local groups and their agreements with the ministry of agriculture were concluded. priority was given to local groups which presented an integrated programme. the measures will in fact start to run in 1997. for pesca, an interim management body was set up but, despite the efforts made, it has not yet been possible to launch the programme. projects approved and now running under the employment initiative, on the other hand, currently total 107 (29 now, 44 horizon, and 34 youthstart projects). now supports the setting up of advisory and guidance services, including services for women managers. youthstart promotes the development of training and guidance in growth sectors such as tourism, the environment and culture. horizon-disabled is mainly concerned with trials to provide sheltered employment, little developed up to now in greece, and to assist the disabled in the workplace. in view of the challenges facing greece due to the arrival of refugees and immigrants from the former ussr, a leading place in horizon has been given to these projects, which account for 45% of the total budget. the number of projects approved under adapt is 115. the dominant theme is the introduction of new technologies and innovative measures for improving business productivity and competitiveness. the project promoters both for employment and adapt are mainly public, but the private sector contributes 10% to the total funding of the measures. it should be noted also that the monitoring of the cips has been streamlined. some monitoring committees are responsible for several programmes of common concern (for example, smes and r\u00e9sider). similarly, the smes initiative has become a forum for discussing all sme measures contained in the csf and the community initiatives. the distribution, lastly, of the community initiatives reserve means that a further ecu 72.5 million can be allocated to all the greek programmes except-smes, chiefly for the new interreg iic, leader and konver17. 17 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 197 it is too early yet to make an assessment of the outlook for the cips, most*of which are still in the start-up phase. interreg-regen gas is undoubtedly well under way, in conjunction with the natural gas op. interreg-external frontiers too is expected to move ahead when social and political conditions in neighbouring countries return to normal. table v-17: greece - community initiatives million) 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 (ecu initiative (no of cips)

potential of the regions the structural funds as the instrument for lasting technology development all the above has had an effect on structural funds aid in the period 1994-99. as the first report on economic and social cohesion points out, regional technology development requires policies that accompany enterprises undergoing technological change and help the workforce adjust so that regional economic structures can modernise and diversify. the structural funds not only provide the regions with the necessary infrastructure for this adjustment, they encourage the regional and local actors to increase regional competitiveness by basing it on innovation and high-valued added industries. to achieve this, investment in technology development has increased strongly between the first and second prograrnming periods, passing from ecu 3.5 billion to ecu 7.5 billion, i.e. 6% of the community funding.21. the approach too has evolved. in the first programming period, the structural funds aimed above all to improve regional capabilities in science and technology by improving rtd infrastructure22 and by helping to develop skills formerly unexploited. this assistance helped public administrations to appreciate the strategic importance of technology development for regional productivity, it encouraged both the forging of links between universities and business and private sector involvement, and facilitated access to the rtd framework programme. in numerical terms, the objective 2 regions devoted the greatest share of appropriations to rtd (9% of the total budget, as against 3% in the objective 1 regions), but community funding in 1994 accounted for a fifth of national spending on research and development in ireland and a third in portugal. the programmes for the period 1994-99 promote a new approach. in the first place, the share devoted to the development of technological potential in the objective 1 regions has increased appreciably (6.5% compared to 2% earlier), while the share in the objective 2 regions has reached 19% and the place of new technologies and their dissemination is increasing in the other objectives and the community initiatives. secondly, it would appear that the regional capacity to innovate and adopt new technologies depends not only on regional supply (r&d capacity and mechanisms to spread the technology), but also, and to an increasing extent, on demand, or more precisely the receptiveness of the economic structure (in particular the smes) which is often insufficient because unable to identify and express its needs. the current programmes therefore try to strengthen enterprise involvement in technology development, to encourage technology transfer from the most developed to the least developed regions and to train users by investing in research infrastructure and developing a definitive strategy based on the market demand rather than on the scientific and technological supply. 21 see chapter la. assistance by objective. 22 thanks to programmes such as ci\u00eancia in portugal (which has created more than 50 new rtd facilities and improved 100 existing ones), the science and technology plan in greece, the scientific infrastructure programmes in spain, the national research and technology development programme in italy, etc. ]98 sth annual report on the structural funds (1996) 5. spain 5.1. implementation of assistance bv objective in 1996 support for the development of technological potential in the regions of spain objective 1: support for technological development is included in several csf priorities. altogether, it represents 5% of community appropriations for the csf. as regards rtd, 1.5% of csf appropriations, primarily under the 'improvement of the system of production ' priority is allocated to the major economic sectors and to businesses, whose level of investment in rtd in 1994 was only half the community average. this priority is being implemented at different levels and in different directions : \u0142 stepping up of public and private rtd activities, encouragement of business participation in rtd and innovation projects, financing of training grants for the private sector in centres of excellence, under the multiregional sub-csf and some regional ops (andalusia, valencia, extremadura, galicia and murcia) which support private investment in rtd and business cooperation with universities and research centres; \u00bb measures for industry and crafts: under the multiregional sub-csf, implemented by means of the 'regional aid for production activities op (ecu 387 million; total cost: ecu 3 126 million): technological upgrading of businesses, distribution of new technologies, participation of businesses in international industrial technology cooperation projects; in some regional ops (andalusia, castile-la mancha, castile-le\u00f4n, valencia, asturias and murcia: support for innovation in production technologies and technology transfer) and in some global grants (murcia, andalusia). rtd is also playing a major role in the modernisation of the agricultural and fisheries sectors, whose low productivity is often linked to a low level of technology. in andalusia, castile-la mancha, valencia, murcia, asturias and galicia, one of the priorities is to spread the use of the most appropriate methods to improve, diversify and realign agricultural production whilst adjusting it to the cap. in the fisheries sector, the main measure under the op for murcia is oc\u00e9anographie research to develop aquaculture. for the development of human resources, the multiregional sub-csf is designed to train research workers in businesses, research centres and universities, and consolidate the rele of the technology transfer offices in the universities. these are measures frequently implemented by means of global grants in andalusia, salamanca, castile-le\u00f4n and murcia, supplemented by most regional ops, which provide support for : \u0142 rtd training measures in businesses (andalusia and valencia) and the development of multimedia educational material to spread new technologies and management methods (andalusia), \u0142 research projects promoting the diversification of economic activities (canary islands), and the strengthening of ties between public research and the production sectors (cantabria, castile-la mancha and extremadura), \u0142 the development of rtd infrastructures and facilities (cantabria, valencia, galicia and murcia), \u0142 basic research, applied research and competitive and pre-competitive research (valencia and galicia), and university research (murcia and extremadura); \u0142 the distribution of information technology (extremadura). outside rtd, the allocation of 2.5% of the total csf budget to telecommunications is particularly noteworthy in view of its important role in spatial structuring. this is a continuation of the efforts of the preceding programming period to iron out regional imbalances in the development of networks and public services. all the regional ops provide for access to the infrastructure for the population as a whole and its modernisation, and greater the use of the network by introducing new advanced services (isdn: from 37% to 65% in 1999). objective 2 (1994-96): the csf defines a strategy focusing on rtd and innovation, and the seven ops contain a priority to promote rtd and information technologies (in total ecu 111.3 million; total cost: ecu 176.8 million). the erdf appropriations under these ops are targeted at the financing of infrastructure (construction and enlargement of premises, acquisition of scientific equipment, laboratory facilities) and research programmes, and at involving research centres in technological development for smes. esf assistance is directed mainly at training for research workers and research centre administrators, the recruitment of research workers and post-graduate study grants for research, science, technology and innovation. examples of the most significant regional ops are : \u0142 aragon : development of the faculty of sciences at the university of zaragoza, the combustion technology research laboratory of the aragon technological institute, and university education (ecu 9.4 million; total cost: ecu 17.6 million); \u0142 catalonia: construction and equipment of faculties, advanced technology institutes and research centres for food, and the establishment of a mediterranean maritime study centre (ecu 20.5 million; total cost: ecu 42 million); \u0142 madrid: development and equipment of the alcal\u00e2 de henares and carlos iii university research 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 199 centres, training for research workers, university study grants (ecu 26.6 million; total cost: ecu 53.5 million); \u0142 navarre: equipment of the regional public university and the navarre technology centre, university study grants for research workers, and support for advanced training (ecu 4.5 million; total cost: ecu 9.3 million): \u0142 basque country: equipment of specialised technology centres and university departments, part-financing of research programmes in those centres, and training for research workers (ecu 31 million; total cost: ecu 67.2 million). this assistance is supplemented by aid measures for the creation and development of technology parks and aid for the technological development of businesses, under the csf priority encouraging business competitiveness. examples are the equipment of the training centre for advanced technologies in zaragoza (aragon), the construction of a technology centre for businesses (balearic islands), the extension of the alcal\u00e0 de henares (madrid) technology park, the development of the zamudio technology park (basque country) and the extension of a research laboratory for car engines (catalonia). the ops for catalonia, rioja and the basque country also encourage business research activities. the regional ops focus less on telecommunications and data transmission applications. however, their development, especially that of telecommunications, does receive support, in a sub-priority of the csf in the 'communications development' priority strategy. objective 3: the esf provides assistance for the implementation of measures on technological training and skill improvement in the most promising sectors and as part of transfer development and application of research, biotechnology and information technology methods. the project for the centre for fashion design in madrid (fundisma) covers industrial, commercial, marketing, technological and training aspects of the textiles and clothing sector. it provides for training measures for the vocational integration of young persons, which include technological training in new design and production methods, the theoretical part being followed by practical work experience. objective 5(b): the priorities in the spds on revitalisation and diversification of the economy provide for support for mechanisation and the development of new technologies. for example, the spd for aragon supports the introduction of new technologies in the production processes of most farming businesses in the bandenas area, and the spd for the basque country stimulates research linked to the development of high-quality regional products. these measures are backed up by support for scientific and technical training and research centres. in total, community financing for technological development in spain

contribution to the csf. they included three major erdf projects, two erdf global grants, two erdf and eaggf ops and four single-fund ops (two erdf and two esf). the three major projects cover energy infrastructure. the first, the gibraltar-cordoba gas pipeline, is one of ten priority energy projects adopted at the essen summit in december 1994 and is part of the development of trans-european energy networks. the second, the valencia-cartagena gas pipeline (first stage paterna - callosa del segura), will play a strategic role for the entire natural gas transport system, because it will enable it to be linked to the future regasification installation in cartagena, thus improving the security of supply for the entire transport network. the third major project, the conversion of the methane tanker unloading installations in huelva, will increase the storage capacity for liquid natural gas at the huelva installation, thus diversifying supply and improving the safety and flexibility of the natural gas transport system in the iberian peninsular as a whole. the project will also contribute to energy diversification and improvement of the environment. the global grant for idae (instituto para la diversif\u00efcaci\u00f4n y el ahorro energ\u00e9tico - institute for energy diversification and saving) is an erdf assistance measure. it is designed to improve energy efficiency and promote renewable energy sources. the grant to castile-la mancha is designed to introduce financing products better suited to the situation of businesses in the region. two of the new ops adopted involve the erdf. the op pitma ii (programa industrial y tecnologico medioambiental - industrial and technological programme for the environment) is designed firstly to develop the supply of technologies, plant, \"green\" products and environmental services for industry, and secondly to reduce or eliminate the pollution caused by industry and industrial products. the op technical assistance is intended to help administrative institutions obtain the best results possible in the programming, management, administration and evaluation of the forms of assistance under the csf. two ops are financed mainly by the eaggf. they are the 'economic development and diversification in rural areas op and the technical assistance programme for statistical updating. as regards implementation of the csf as a whole in 1996, the csf monitoring committee, meeting in december, decided to add a new sub-priority \"information society\", designed to encourage the use of new computing technology by public service authorities, in job creation and technological innovation, and provide equal access to information. the commission has also ordered an analysis with a view to simplifying and rationalising aid programmes by means of an inspection and monitoring system, to prevent any cumulation of aid. as regards assessment, the reports on part one have already been drawn up and submitted in the various monitoring committees. the report on the csf is to be drawn up in the second half of 1997. 18 eligible areas: andalusia, asturias, canary islands, cantabria, castile-le\u00f4n, castile-la mancha, extremadura, galicia, murcia, valencia, ceuta and melilla. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 201 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 95% of the amount originally provided for in the csf was programmed (ecu 769.4 million under the erdf is still to be programmed). the most dynamic autonomous communities in terms of the level of implementation are valencia, ceuta, the canary islands, cantabria and galicia. in terms of priorities, most progress was made with 'integration and spatial structuring', followed by 'development of the economic fabric' and 'infrastructures to support economic activities\". in terms of institutions, the highest rate of implementation was recorded by the central authorities, followed by the regional authorities, public enterprises and local authorities. implementation of the fisheries programme progressed at a rate of 100% of the 1994 instalment, 80% of that for 1995 and 25% of that for 1996, thus making it possible to pay the member state the second advance for 1996 (i.e. 34% of the total programmed for the period 1994-99). nevertheless, the annual timetable was reprogrammed in november, to transfer ecu 56 million of the 1995 instalment to the 1996 instalment and take account of indexation for 1994/95 in the 1996 instalment. objective 219 fie. v-20: proerammine 1994-96 (ecu

ground by the end of december 1996, representing community financing of ecu 990 million, i.e. 88% of the contribution originally laid down in the csf. this structural fund financing was made up of ecu 781.4 million from the erdf (i.e. 90% of the allocation originally provided for), ecu 368.3 million of which was actually paid out in the member state in 1994-1995, and a total of ecu 208.6 million financed by the esf (i.e. 80% of the allocation originally provided for), ecu 98.6 million of which was actually paid out in 1994 and 1995. completion meant that an unused amount of ecu 139.3 million could be transferred to the 1997-99 programming period (12% of the original csf assistance), plus ecu 16.1 million20 from indexation of the csf for 1995 and 1996. these transfers relate to the seven regional ops under the csf, and range from 6% of the original assistance under the op (basque country) to 38% (aragon). 19 eligible areas: aragon, balearic islands, catalonia, rioja, madrid, navarre,

recipient autonomous communities, and one multiregional esf assistance measure for all regions). despite the commission's recommendations, the central spanish authorities chose to use, as in 1994-96, the three-stage procedure (conversion plan, csf and op). as with the csf for 1994-96,-the plan has six priorities and is based on one single part-financing rate of 50% for all measures21. the proposed distribution of community assistance is ecu 1 023 million from the erdf and ecu 295.2 million from the esf. preparatory meetings between the central authorities and the commission were held in october and december 1996. following approval of the csf, the proposed ops will have to be adjusted considerably in line with the csf priorities and to take account of the transfer of appropriations from the

the vocational training system. the csf promotes the concentration of resources on facilitating access to and improving the quality of training, and greater use of integrated formulas (sandwich courses, training and placement services). four of the eleven ops (71 % of the total amount) are managed by national bodies, the other seven (29% of the total amount) by the autonomous communities. the average implementation rate for the programmes is satisfactory, with 100% of available appropriations for 1996, i.e. ecu 244.1 million, being committed and 75% paid out in the form of advances. as regards monitoring, the partnership and the strategic role of the monitoring committee have been reinforced. the committee ensures that the approach defined in the programming documents is followed and has approved adjustments to 21 the regional breakdown of the new appropriations allocated by spain for this period (ecu 1318 million) is as follows: aragon, ecu 82.9 million; balearic islands, ecu

instalment to 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. as regards quality, it was the commission's concern not to lose sight of the priorities in the spd, with the focus on training in smes, giving priority to the least skilled workers and promoting equal opportunities. the emphasis was also on horizontal training in the framework of objective 4, i.e. concentration of measures on skills common to more than one sector and linking training to anticipated demand. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-20: proerammine 1994-99 (ecu million - 1996 prices and status): total 276,0 measures production marketing 157.0

sector), as against the ecu 207 million originally provided for in 1994. this was because in 1996 spain decided to transfer part of the appropriations originally allocated to these measures to aid measures for processing and marketing fruit and vegetables. a decision on the spd for this is to be taken in 1997. most of this revised aid is investment aid (ecu 46 million), followed by aid for less-favoured regions (ecu 43 million) and aid for young farmers (ecu 35 million). in the years following preparation of the spd on processing and marketing of products in 1994, application of the measure has been standardised. in those regions not covered by objective l22, the community awarded a total of ecu 68 million (ecu 32 million in 1995 and ecu 36 million in 1996) for 496 investments with total eligible costs of ecu 313 million (ecu 146 million in 1995 and ecu 167 million in 1996). more than 50% of investments in the objective 1 regions and in those outside objective 1 were in the fruit and vegetable and meat sectors. 22 eaggf aid was ecu 351 million (ecu 120 million in 1995 and ecu 131 million in 1996). the total eligible cost of the 1 235 investments receiving aid was ecu 821

was that 50% of the financial allocation was committed by the end of 1996 and 36% paid out. the situation for the eaggf (4 regions brought forward commitment of the 1997 instalment) was very satisfactory, but there were problems with the esf, for which, by the end of 1996, two regions had committed barely 25% of the appropriations provided for the period. the assistance under four of the seven spds (balearic islands, rioja, navarre and the basque country) was indexed, which represents an additional total of ecu 2.9 million for these programmes. the work of the monitoring committees focused on approval of the technical assistance programmes for each region, comprising three strands (information on the measures provided for in the spd, technical assistance for implementation and assessment), on assignment of the amount resulting from indexation for 1995-96, allocated to the financing of these technical assistance programmes (on average these appropriations account for 0.2% of the public expenditure provided for in the programmes), and finally on the stepping up of some of the most advanced measures. however, most effort went into assessment work, concentrating on feasibility studies in the seven regions to improve prior appraisal and prepare on-going assessment, approval of the list of specifications and selection of assessors for on-going assessment (four regions had assessment carried out by universities and three others by private companies), and the organisation within the framework of the national monitoring committee of a seminar on the assessment of rural development programmes, in which the assessors for the seven regions took part. 23 eligible areas: aragon. balearic islands. catalonia. rioja, madrid, navarre and the basque country. 8th

5.2. implementation of the community initiatives in 1996 note: spain is involved in all community initiatives. each initiative is implemented by a single national programme, with the exception of leader (17 global grants in each autonomous community, ten of which in the objective 1 regions). 23 of these cips and two interreg cips were adopted in 1994 and 1995. five of the six programmes still to be decided (interreg spain-france, interreg spain-morocco, rechar, r\u00e9sider and the smes initiative) were adopted in 1996 (leaving the konver programme outstanding). support for the development of technological potential in spain : the smes programme gives greatest priority to technological development. in order to raise the competitive level of smes, the cip supports training in information technology and its more widespread use (ecu 13.5 million; total cost: ecu 36.9 million), and rtd (ecu 56.9 million; total cost: ecu 134.4 million). there are also measures to improve data transmission links between companies to facilitate contact with their clients, suppliers and administration departments. all these priorities are implemented by means of the arte programme, which encourages the use of advanced communications by smes through various measures: support for new initiatives by financing studies, analysis and technical assessment for individual smes or groups of businesses, encouraging the use of advanced communications services by developing business information, the development of innovative solutions based on data transmission applications, and the improvement of technological services centres for businesses. most of the budget for the interreg programmes with france, portugal and morocco is given over to technological development for the installation of fibre optics and the setting up of advanced telecommunications services (ecu 10.4 million; total cost: ecu 24.8 million). as regards the adapt initiative, the cip encourages cooperation between research and training centres and the public and private sectors, whereas the employment programme focuses on data transmission applications (ecu 9.8 million; total cost: ecu 15.1 million) as a means of reducing barriers affecting the handicapped, and, under the now programme, on the use of computerised data bases. finally, the regis programme finances the setting up of an advanced communications centre to stimulate the locally-generated development of the canary islands based on technology transfers between the university and the private sector, and projects on the introduction of advanced infrastructure services in most sectors of the economy. support for rtd in the form of the development of the canary islands astrophysics institute receives 2% of the budget. by the end of 1996, all cips had been adopted except konver. the cips adopted in 1996 include the smes cip, to which ecu 251.1 million has been allocated, and the r\u00e9sider cip, which covers several regions - asturias, cantabria, valencia, galicia, navarre and the basque country - which are eligible under objectives 1 and 2. the rechar cip was also approved in 1996 for several coal-mining areas in andalusia, aragon, asturias, catalonia, castile-leon and galicia, all located in area eligible under objectives 1, 2 or 5(b). the interreg programme for spain-morocco, which has been allocated ecu 101.4 million of assistance from the erdf and ecu 1.1 million from the esf, was also approved. in addition, spain receives an additional ecu 312.96 million by way of the community initiative reserve. this amount will reinforce the initiatives adapt, employment, leader, pesca, retex, urban and above all the new strand interreg iic24. implementation of the regis programme and the leader programmes, both among the programmes adopted in previous years, began satisfactorily. for the latter, which were approved in july 1995, 1996 focused on the establishment of innovation programmes by 15 groups on skill acquisition and implementation by 20 innovation groups. under the employment initiative, almost 500 projects were selected following the first invitation to tender (174 projects for now, 230 horizon projects and 94 youthstart projects). the three strands focus on training and the promotion of new services, in particular in rural areas. the main themes of the now projects are the development of employment programmes and the promotion of traditional activities in rural areas. under youthstart, there are a large number of projects for implementing vocational integration programmes. horizon focuses on eliminating obstacles to access to work, and on the promotion of advice facilities and the use of new technologies. under adapt, 184 projects were selected following the first invitation to tender. training activities play a major role, in particular in areas linked to new technologies. other activities 24 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 21 more support for technology development is needed while qualitative progress has undoubtedly been achieved, thanks in particular to the boost given by the community initiatives and pilot projects, more assistance is necessary. in the field of research and technology development, 1996 provided an opportunity to reassess the relationship between the cohesion policy and the rtd policy. the relationship was on the one hand studied in the first cohesion report. then, following the conclusions of the panel assessing rtd measures taken during the last five years, in april 1997 the commission adopted the proposal on the 5th framework programme for 1999-02.23 following the green paper on innovation24, it also adopted an action plan for innovation25. it also decided to prepare a communication on cohesion, innovation, rtd and competitiveness, extending the 1993 communication on the same subject. this was adopted in 1997. on information technologies, the commission adopted a communication entitled \"cohesion and the information society\"26 with a view to having greater account taken of this new dimension in the structural fund programmes. the communication recognises the interdependence of economic and social cohesion and the development of the information society in europe. this involves successfully exploiting the interaction between these two spheres of activity at increasingly sophisticated levels of complimentarity. the introduction of the information society is a pivotal factor for regional development. the new developments in information and communications technologies have significant and inescapable effects on employment opportunities, lifestyles and the regional organisation and spread of economic activity. the information society affects the ability of enterprises to diversify and adapt their product range, to increase their penetration into regional and local markets and to imagine new and more effective forms of organisation. the general impact of the information society on all society activities, i.e. education and training, health services, leisure and recreations, public administration, etc, is also creating a new pattern for social relationships. while the communication acknowledges the structural funds' contribution to completing and improving telecommunications infrastructure, it also calls for a new approach. a whole series of factors going beyond telecommunications alone are a precondition for true entry into the information society, among which can be cited, the educational and training levels reached by the general population, the roles of the public and private sectors in promoting the information society, public awareness, the ability to organise and invest in an efficient information society strategy. in this regard the communication recognizes the extra effort that must be made as regards telecommunications infrastructure and legislation so that cohesion might be more effectively integrated into the process. the communication notes however that a major effort is needed to stimulate demand by identifying the regional strategies for the information society, by developing training programmes for businessmen and public administrators, by supporting new applications development, by launching public information campaigns through the establishment of public/private partnerships. the structural funds are the instrument through which such an integrated, coordinated approach can be developed and through which inter-regional partnerships can be tried out. 23 com(97) 142 final of 30 april 1997.

promotion of businesses in the social economy sector. although implementation of the pesca programme did not really begin until the end of 1995, no new payments were made in 1996, some measures being replaced by others and the amounts involved reallocated between the funds. table v-22: spain - community initiatives million) 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 (ecu initiative (number of

obiective in 199625 support for the development of technological potential in the regions of france: objective 1: all the spds take account of the technology factor. in the fields of rtd and innovation, the spds which go furthest in exploiting the potential for technology development are those for corsica and nord/pas-de- calais: \u0142 in nord/pas-de-calais: the rtd priority (ecu 38.4 million; total cost: ecu 86.8 million) includes development of rtd in businesses, strengthening the supply of technology and strategic services by skills centres and networks, technology training and stimulation of research in higher education. these measures are supplemented by the development of environmental technologies (ecu 9.8 million; total cost: ecu 31.8 million) and incentives for environmental research (ecu 1.5 million; total cost: ecu 3 million); \u0142 in corsica: the programme is built around technology transfer in agricultural and marine production (ecu 1.6 million; total cost: ecu 3.7 million) and in businesses, research (ecu 1.4 million; total cost: ecu 3.5 million) and the development of human resources in those areas (ecu 0.8 million; total cost: ecu 2 million). objective 2 (1994-96): rtd and innovation play a key role in the spds (20.9% of structural fund assistance). several spds allocate a total of ecu 236.15 million (total cost: ecu 531.8 million) to priorities concerning the development of training and research in businesses (ecu 174.2 million; total cost: ecu 371.4 million)26, increasing regional r&d and innovation capacity (ecu 42.9 million; total cost: ecu 114.3 million)27 and improving the technological environment of firms (loire region: ecu 19 million; total cost: ecu 46,2 million). these priorities, and the measures included in the other spds, reflect the general interest in encouraging r&d and innovation. this involves aid for innovative projects (alsace, lorraine, lower normandy and champagne-ardenne), aid for research28 (ecu 12.9 million; total cost: ecu 40.3 million) and, more specifically, the development of environmental technologies29 and new information technology and communications (nord/pas-de-calais: ecu 8.3 million; total cost: ecu 16.6 million). in addition to these measures, the spds specifically aim to assist technology development in businesses (ecu 61.5 million in all; total cost: ecu 172.4 million) by stimulating demand for30 or supply of1 rtd, by strengthening technology development programmes (lower normandy), through inter-regional and international cooperation in the field of research (upper normandy), by strengthening existing skills centres and networks and encouraging the r&d efforts of businesses32, and by granting aid for technology dissemination (alsace), including support for technology transfer in smes (ecu 14.7 million; total cost: ecu 46.3 million)33. the spds also concentrate on r&d and technology transfer structures (ecu 23.7 million; total cost: ecu 51 million)34, university and research facilities (centre: ecu 1.2 million; total cost: ecu 3.9 million), the 25 in addition to the assistance for 1994-99 set out below, during 1996 the closure process began for certain assistance adopted by the commission before 1989. payment of balances amounted to about ecu 36 million. the following were closed: three major projects adopted in 1989 (guadeloupe, champ\u00e0gne-ardenne) and 1992 (midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es); three idos (tam-aveyron, nord/pas-de-calais, brittany) adopted in 1986-88; the imps for languedoc-roussillon and aquitaine adopted in 1987; the npcis for lorraine, the european development pole and charente-maritime adopted in 1986-87; the rechar cip for burgundy and the envireg cip for provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur adopted in 1990; five objective 2 programmes for 1989-91 (lorraine, aquitaine, midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, paca); the objective 5(b) programme for limousin adopted in 1990. 26 auvergne, brittany, nord/pas-de-calais,

development of centres of excellence (e.g. life industries in lower normandy (ecu 2.9 million; total cost: ecu 8.7 million) and technology platforms in aquitaine (ecu 9.8 million; total cost: ecu 41 million)). in most of the spds this support for rtd and innovation is accompanied by human resource measures. such measures are either general and aim at strengthening training in research (ecu 18.1 million in all; total cost: ecu 54.1 million)35, or more specific (ecu 49.7 million in all; total cost: ecu 96.3 million), aiming to develop advanced scientific training3**, strengthen secondary and higher technical education in conjunction with the skills centres in the area37 and finance research grants for technology transfer centres38, or develop vocational training centres39, training for managers and research technicians40 and researchers, advanced technicians and r&d advisers41, or again technology facilities for training and apprenticeship structures42. in addition to these measures, some programmes link the increase in training capacity to the strengthening of the ties between research, skills centres, higher and technical training establishments and businesses (ecu 79.7 million in all; total cost: ecu 173.2 million)43. this approach is also found in other measures, such as the adaptation of job-seekers' skills to the labour market (brittany: ecu 2.3 million (total cost: ecu 5.2 million)), support for links between jobs and training (brittany: ecu 2.1 million (total cost: ecu 4 million); picardy: ecu 15.5 million (total cost: ecu 31.5 million)). objective 5(b): the 20 spds provide support for technology development in rural areas as part of the effort to strengthen the business and industrial fabric in those areas. measures include support for new technologies (upper normandy, auvergne and the upland areas of languedoc-roussillon), development of research (upper normandy, languedoc-ro\u00fbssillon, rh\u00f4ne-alpes), introduction of new production processes (upper normandy), technology transfer (languedoc-roussillon, limousin, champagne-ardenne, loire region), and training in innovation (midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es) and research (auvergne, languedoc-roussillon, lorraine), and the encouragement of competitive know-how (e.g. auvergne, massif central). rtd also plays a key role in the adaptation and diversification of agriculture and forestry (auvergne, brittany, midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es). in all, financing for technology development in france accounts for 7% of structural fund appropriations (objectives 1, 2 and

corsica, french guiana, guadeloupe and martinique, were amended. the largest amendment concerned the spd for guadeloupe and took the form of reprogramming needed to repair the damage done by a number of cyclonic storms during the summer of 1995. implementation of the programmes for the antilles was seriously held up by these storms. in french guiana, implementation of the current programmers delayed because the necessary resources must first be allocated to closing the programme for the first period. by contrast, the programme for r\u00e9union is running smoothly and the three first instalments and the corresponding first advance payments are due to be committed and paid at the beginning of 1997. however, the programmes for the overseas departments have not yet really got underway in the fisheries sector. by the end of 1996 fewer than ten projects had been adopted. this is because aid for the construction of vessels has been suspended and it has been difficult to find private-sector projects for aquaculture and the processing and marketing of products. several projects concerning facilities for fishing ports have been launched. in corsica, the programme is making more satisfactory progress (26% of planned investments have been committed). with regard to the evaluation exercise, the monitoring committees had appointed all the teams of independent assessors by the end of 1996. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 as expected, most of the spds got off to a siow start, particularly in corsica, guadeloupe, french guiana and martinique. community commitments stood at about 31% for these four spds, with payments at around 22% of all the appropriations available for 1994-99. objective 2 7p *\u00bb44 fie. v-28: proerammine 1994-96 (ecu million -

(ecu 1 790 million after indexing). the spds were closed at a total of ecu 1 582 million, i.e. 88% of the initial allocation. hence only four of the programmes (alsace, franche-comt\u00e9, upper normandy and poitou-charentes) were fully implemented. the remaining ecu 208.6 million not yet spent will be transferred to the new appropriations for 1997-99 for the same regions. 44 eligible areas:

by the structural funds and completed\" in 1996, the following deserve to be mentioned: \u0142 in provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur, two industrial projects in the microprocessor sector, atmel (new factory, creation of 700 new jobs) and cgs thomson (extension of a factory, creation of 250 new jobs); \u0142 in lower normandy, creation of a skills centre for life industries at cherbourg, including a specialised research and training centre, a technological innovation centre for the development of innovative products and a marine technology centre. this project led directly to the creation of 175-jobs; \u0142 in nord/pas-de-calais, the renovation programme for the districts of cap\u00e9cure at boulogne-sur-mer. the programme involved renovating an industrial area concerned with fisheries and sea food to bring it up to standard. the total investment is estimated at ecu 185 million over six years and includes the modernisation of businesses (to bring them up to the european standards), rehabilitation of industrial wasteland, infrastructure and port facilities. during 1994-96. the structural funds contributed ecu 21.5 million to the financing of a programme costing ecu 118.5 million to convert industrial wasteland and port facilities. 140 firms were involved, with 4 000 direct jobs and as many indirect ones; \u0142 in upper normandy, community assistance in the dieppe employment area, where unemployment is high, at 16%, led to the implementation of an integrated operation to redevelop and modernise the port (trade and cross-channel traffic), to connect it to the national and european road network and create the eurochannel activity park (industrial estate, business incubator facilities, business hotel). the operation received ecu 13 million from the erdf. specialising in industrial activities and related services, eurochannel has provided a home for 50 firms, some international (toshiba) and others smes (plastics, sea food). of the 7 000 jobs in the dieppe employment area, almost 1 000 were created by this operation; \u0142 in aquitaine, the firm serma technologies created at pessac the first european centre for testing electronic components and the physical and electrical microanalysis of physical circuits with an investment of ecu 3.34 million. 42 new jobs were created in addition to the 23 people already employed by the company. this analysis, test and expertise centre has achieved scientific validation through the close collaboration it has developed with the university of bordeaux i and the micro-electronics laboratory (ixl) linked to the cnrs (national centre for scientific research). the operation was carried out with erdf assistance worth ecu 570 000, which acted as a catalyst enabling the firm to carry out its investments more rapidly and to recruit a much greater number of staff than that initially planned; \u0142 a second project in aquitaine was implemented by the firm s.a. serta (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes and de r\u00e9alisations techniques d'aquitaine), located at saint jean d'lllac, which has high level technology potential in a variety of fields: research offices, mass-production manufacture, sheet-metal work, paint, optical grinding and quality (iso 9002 certification). the investment committed at the end of 1996 amounted to ecu 860 000 and concerned production facilities for high-speed machining and automated design and management. erdf assistance accounted for 25% of the investment and helped create some 20 jobs. preparation for the 1997-99 programming period at the end of 1996 the french authorities had sent the commission 20 proposals for spds (19 regional programmes and one national programme for technical assistance). 214 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) objectives

by unemployment. most of those targeted by the measures implemented are aged under 25 (60%). in 1996, ecu 421.6 million of the initially planned annual instalment of ecu 478.9 million was committed, and the first and second advances were paid. the implementation rate for 1996 was 79%. at its meeting in november 1996 the monitoring committee proposed some reprogramming, mainly involving the replacement of certain measures in priority 1 (training with access to a job, return-to-work contracts, aid for unemployed who create or take over a business, retraining leave agreements) and priority 2 (partnership fund) with new measures. in financial terms, the reprogramming involved the transfer of some ecu 200 million from priority 1 to priority 3 (integration of those threatened with exclusion). efforts were also made in 1996 to correct and improve certain aspects of the management of several measures. fie. v-30: objective 4 - proerammine 1994-96 (ecu million -1996prices):

national) to 2 076 in 1996 (2 049 regional and 27 national). in financial terms, about 58% of the 1996 instalment was implemented, as against about 25% in 1995. although, during 1995, the training priority was implemented almost exclusively, to the detriment of priorities 1 and 3, the number of projects for these two priorities increased sharply during the first half of 1996. moreover, projects concerning more than one priority are beginning to appear. however, this diversification is less evident when looking at costs, since 91% of the regional budgets and 93% of national budgets are allocated to the training priority. projects are fairly evenly spread across the different sectors and work forces. 73% of participants are employed by establishments with less than 250 employees. while financing in 1995 was concentrated on the large firms in the automobile, electrical engineering and electronics industries, in 1996 a wider range of firms benefited, particularly at regional level. this is the result of the waning, in financial terms, of the large projects in the automobile industry (the proportion of the regional budgets allocated to firms with more than 1 000 employees has shrunk from 35% to 20%, and that of the car industry from 33% to 22%). this relative dispersion does not seem to be having much effect on the breakdown by sex and by qualification of those benefiting from training measures: early information suggests a very slight increase, at regional 45 by priority: vocational integration of the unemployed: 87%; vocational integration of young people: 74%; integration of those threatened with exclusion: 60%; equal opportunities: 70%; technical assistance: 16%; pilot projects: 19.5%. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 215 level, of the number of women (from 20% to 24%) and an increase in the number of white-collar staff (from 16% to 26%) to the detriment of other qualifications. despite these changes, there is little change in the characteristics of the projects themselves. objective 5(a) agriculture table 24: proerammine 1994-99 (ecu million - 1994 prices): total 1.745,5 measures production mprtgting 1.486,6 2-5s.9 85% 15% the three main measures to improve the efficiency of production structures are aid for the modernisation of farms, aid to young farmers and compensatory allowances. investment aid for modernisation was paid to 9 213 farms in 1995 (number of approvals), i.e. up 24% on the year before, which itself was 27% up on 1994. this second year of growth confirms the upward trend in the number of commitments which started in 1993. where young farmers are concerned, 8 435 start-up dossiers were approved in 1995, i.e. a 6.2% increase on 1994. after a sharp fall in 1992 and no change in the number of start-ups since, this new increase suggests a fresh surge in start-up aid, which is seen as a priority in france. lastly, concerning compensatory allowances, which are granted to some 140 000 holdings each year, the amount of the premiums granted for suckler cows and sheep was increased in 1995/96 to take account of the structurally low income of stock farmers. despite increased participation by farmers in the measures described above, expenditure during 1995 was lower than expected. the spds to assist the processing and marketing of agricultural and forestry products were drawn up in 1994 and the decentralised implementing structures were set up in 1995. community assistance was finally applied fully in 1996, when an agreement was reached to grant aid in the wine sector for investments to improve quality. community assistance for these measures for 1994-99 amounts to ecu 259 million. at the end of 1996, the french authorities had cornmitted ecu 163 million of that amount, corresponding to ecu 862 million of investments in the approved projects. more than 50% of community assistance was granted to investments in the meat, fruit and vegetables sectors. objective 5(a)

amount is still insufficient to make up the delays from 1994 and 1995. 72% of these appropriations have been paid, demonstrating a sound ability to implement operations in the field. the monitoring cornmittees met in each of the 18 regions concerned, holding a total of 35 meetings, including those of the inter-regional monitoring committees set up for the two \"massif spds (massif central and massif des pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es). during these meetings the harmonised monitoring arrangements were set up. special attention was paid to midterm assessment that the data needed to adjust the spds would be available for 1997. the commission steered the work of the cornmittees to monitor the development priorities laid down for each region. to that end, it worked in partnership with the regional and national authorities to standardise and harmonise the financial and physical data forwarded to the monitoring committees. alongside the progress of the programmes, specific presentations were given of priority aspects such as employment, the quality of agricultural products and measures for job-creating small firms and industries. 46 eligible areas: alsace, aquitaine, auvergne, lower normandy,

8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 6.2. implementation of the community initiatives in 1996 note: france is participating in all the community initiatives, which are being implemented in 85 programmes, including 15 for interreg, all regionalised except for five (employment, adapt, retex, smes for objectives 2 and 5(b) and pesca). the commission had adopted 52 programmes in 1994 and 1995 (47 at national level): one for employment, five for interreg, six for rechar ii, five for r\u00e9sider, the amendment of the retex programme, three programmes for smes, one for regis, all the konver programmes, the pesca programme, the adapt programme and eleven programmes for leader. the 33 remaining programmes were adopted in 1996: three for regis, one for rechar, two for r\u00e9sider, eight for urban, nine for leader and ten for interreg. support for the development of technological potential in france: the smes initiative gives a key role to new technologies and innovation in strengthening the competitiveness of firms in areas eligible under objectives i, 2 and 5(b). in corsica, smes is helping to improve the production system and create innovative firms as well as to develop new forms of cooperation between firms to facilitate access to new markets, and cooperation between firms and research and technology transfer centres. it also aims to improve communications and information systems and develop tele-commuting. in nord/pas-de-calais, the initiative gives priority to improving the technological environment of smes, particularly those up- and downstream of industrial firms (ecu 1.5 million; total cost: ecu 6 million). in the objective 2 and 5(b) areas, the programme aims to set up new procedures and disseminate know-how. in this connection it is promoting the creation of a 'counter-guarantee fund' for smes implementing partnership or innovative projects and the creation of european partnerships and collective modernisation and innovation projects (between 70 and 100) as an extension of the stride programme. the interreg programmes also attribute great importance to rtd (ecu 20.6 million; total cost: ecu 42.4 million), communications (ecu 4.4 million; total cost: ecu 9.4 million) and data-transmission applications (ecu 4.4 million; total cost: ecu 9.1 million): \u0142 france-united kingdom: the cip for east sussex-upper normandy-picardy supports cooperation between research and technology transfer centres for the benefit of smes and aims to stimulate communication and the sharing of knowledge through joint databases, bilingual documentation sources and the use of new communications technologies (ecu 3.2 million; total cos: ecu 6.5 million); the programme for nord/pas-de-calais - kent also aims to strengthen communications and support technology development (ecu 8.5 million; total cost: ecu 18.2 million); \u0142 france-italy: the programme for corsica-tuscany gives priority to encouraging technology transfer in order to stimulate cooperation between firms and research and innovation centres; the programme for the alps encourages firms to cooperate in the field of research. under regis, ecu 7.1 million (total cost: ecu 14.4 million) are allocated to advanced communications and ecu 13.9 million (total cost: ecu 38.6 million) to rtd. in the context of the industrial conversion initiatives, the programmes for konver aim to strengthen technology potential (e.g. ile-de-france: ecu 0.5 million; total cost: ecu 4.9 million) through research and technology transfer to smes and industries which can play a decisive role in economic diversification (e.g. limousin: ecu 1.8 million (total cost: ecu 4.6 million), midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es: ecu 1 million (total cost: ecu 2.5 million), aquitaine, auvergne, brittany, poitou-charentes) and to develop innovative measures in firms (e.g. brittany, languedoc-roussillon). under the r\u00e9sider programmes the emphasis is on networking. in picardy ecu 0.5 million (total cost: ecu 1.5 million) is allocated to the development of technology networks in the rehabilitated areas, while in nord/pas-de-calais, the programme encourages cooperation between skills centres and firms by means of information highways and the use of communications technology by small firms. in lower normandy, an electronic information management network will be set up between firms and the university of caen. the programmes for rechar also stress the importance of cooperation, with the programme for nord/pas-de-calais, for example, encouraging cooperation between skills centres and firms based on new technologies. regarding the initiatives concerned with human resources, the adapt programme allocates part of its resources to the design and implementation of flexible training schemes based on the use of new technologies and distance education (ecu 12 million; total cost: ecu 24 million), alongside the creation of new activities or the introduction of new technologies and studies on the impact of new technologies on human resources. employment provides, in the context of the horizon initiative, for the development of human resources in new technologies, tele-commuting and the creation of the infrastructure necessary for tele-commuting and distance learning (ecu 14.1 million; total cost: ecu 36.1 million). lastly, most of the leader programmes provide for the promotion of research, innovation and new technologies in the process of developing and creating local products, and the use of new information and communication technologies in rural society (e.g. tele-commuting, distance education and training, tele-centres, etc.), including assistance for the purchase of equipment and development of networks. . 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 219 many programmes were adopted in 1996: 23 regional programmes and the last ten interreg programmes: three with belgium (wallonia-champagne-ardenne, flanders-nord/pas-de-calais, wallonia-nord/pas-de-calais), one with belgium and luxembourg (wallonia-lorraine-luxembourg), one with spain, three with italy (corsica-tuscany, corsica-sardinia, alps) and two with the united kingdom (east sussex-upper normandy-picardy, kent-nord/pas-de-calais). under the programme between france and spain, geographical cross-border groups consisting of partners from both sides of the border have been set up to plan the joint measures provided for in the programme. the regional programmes adopted in 1996 include one rechar programme (nord/pas-de-calais) and two r\u00e9sider programmes (nord/pas-de-calais and lower normandy). they also include eight urban programmes, which offer many lessons for future programmes, since they seek to integrate unemployed inhabitants through economic activity in problem-ridden urban districts in eight large french cities. three of the four regis programmes were also adopted in 1996. these concern the remotest regions and cover all the community initiatives including leader. their implementation got off to a slow start, on the one hand because of the need to close the programmes from 1989-93 and, on the other hand, because of bad weather in the antilles. the last nine leader programmes were also adopted in 1996. the local action groups for the whole initiative were selected in most regions by tendering procedure administered at prefecture level. 14 regions made an initial selection of a total of 87 local action groups, enabling the first programmes to get underway in the second half of 1996. following the first call for projects under employment, around 500 projects were selected (157 for now, 261 for horizon and 83 for youthstart). most of the projects take the approach of creating activities and integration pathways and include a number of innovative practices: in the case of training programmes, these practices include inter-institutional and multi-disciplinary work, the means and tools used to improve the integration pathways (therapeutic listening, creativity workshops, theatre, video, writing workshops, cultural visite), enhancing the expertise of field-workers, overhauling teaching methods and practices, deepening relationships with firms and coordinating with local development. practices worth mentioning in connection with the creation of activities include tools to facilitate the creation of activities, financing tools, the inclusion of social clauses in public procurement contracts, involvement of inhabitants and local authorities in promising new markets and new working methods, particularly tele-commuting. in the context of improving training schemes, new vocational profiles have been defined, with the observatories acting to stimulate innovation in existing local schemes, training trainers/educators and the different categories of social workers. 270 projects were selected under adapt, with a high level of participation among small firms (on average almost 100 per project), which correspond to one of the situations targeted (improving the skills of employees in smes to take account of changes in technology and markets, quality measures tailored to smes, support for a human resources management culture in smes, networks for cooperation between smes) the other noteworthy feature of the projects concerns the general phenomenon of the development, transformation or emergence of new skills, giving priority to technological developments, particularly those linked with the information society. the monitoring committees of the 33 programmes approved by the commission in the second half of 1995 also held their first meetings in 1996 (six of the seven rechar programmes; five of the seven r\u00e9sider programmes; the three smes programmes; the regis programme for r\u00e9union; the 13 konver programmes and five of the 15 interreg programmes) the selection of projects for pesca at regional level did not begin until the end of 1995 or even early 1996 and information on the progress of the programme is not yet available. lastly, the decision to distribute the community initiatives reserve will bring an additional ecu 187.7 million to france. this amount has been spread over all the initiatives except smes and regis, but the lion's share will go to employment. leader, urban and adapt47. 41 see also chapter i.b.i. community

for the productive sector, economic infrastructure and hufnan resources, the csf promotes technological development to resolve unemployment, weaknesses in local industry and the country's peripheral location. the productive sector priority sees r&d as important for making industry internationally competitive. the aim is to increase expenditure on r&d to 2.12% of gdp in 1999. in the 'industrial development' op, which is a prolongation of the 'industrial development' op for the period 1989-93, r&d measures qualify for ecu 269 million (total cost ecu 499 million) and encourage the use of technology in business through aid for infrastructure, investment and training. business investment measures promote technology transfer. they aim to increase business expenditure on r&d from 0.65% of gdp to 0.82% in 1999. outside the industrial sector r&d is aided to modernise agriculture, explore and exploit natural marine resources and protect the environment. the 'environmental services' op includes ecu 3.1 million (total cost: ecu 6.3 million) for monitoring environmental research into sustainable development, clean technology and industrial waste reduction. the r&d strategy is further strengthened by a 'human resources' priority to improve access to and the quality of education and training in science and technology while developing human potential in these fields through specific training courses in the technical colleges and universities. the esf will aid highly qualified researchers involved in industrial r&d projects, technology management programmes for qualified staff in research centres and industry, and training and educational programmes in advanced research and the application of new technology. aid for telecommunications as one of the sectors in the strategy to modernise the economic infrastructure is also noteworthy. csf investment on this is 65% greater than in the first programming period. such an increase is needed, not because the network needs modernising - it is already one of the most advanced and reliable in the union in terms of digitisation (70%), speed of repairs and the wait for new connections - but because the adverse effects of the country's peripheral location on its industrial strategy need to be reduced. the csf aims to complete the digitisation of the network, install the entire c7 signals system and an sdh network. the telecommunications subprogramme of the 'economic infrastructure ' op is implementing this objective (ecu 32 million - total cost ecu 68 million). considerable work will be done on connections, transmission (using fibre optics) and mobile services (introduction of gsm). total funding on technological development amounts to 6.4% of the structural funds appropriations in the irish csf. table

structural funds. implementation of the various programmes has progressed normally. the technical assistance' op was approved by the commission in july 1996, which means that all the ops have now been adopted. most of the programmes have also been adjusted to take account of the deflator for 1995 and 1996 and to reprogramme expenditure. thus, taking programmes in receipt of eaggf funding as an example, the 'agriculture and rural development' op, approved in 1994, is now fully operational with the exception of two minor operations; the 'development of the food industry' subprogramme of the industry op has been amended to take account of its slow pace in the early years and the 'local development' op, which includes village renewal measures, is in line with expenditure forecasts. great progress has been achieved under the fisheries op (reprogramming was needed to bring forward cornmitments from 1997). while the scheme introduced in 1995 to reduce the fishing fleet progressed little in 1996 and there has been a delay in implementing aquaculture legislation, 350 jobs were nonetheless created in aquaculture and there is a surplus of good projects in the area of fleet modernisation and fishery products processing. a research vessel was built with an erdf contribution, recommendations on safety at sea were published and an major campaign was launched to promote sea food. a special csf information unit was set up in 1996 to coordinate information on the csf in ireland and to improve its quality. in addition, agreement was reached on the light rail system for dublin (luas) under the transport op. the preparations for ongoing assessment of the csf and the ops were started by approving the terms of reference and appointing evaluators. an evaluation of the aid's regional impact has also been commissioned, while a draft report has already been produced by the independent consultants evaluating the fisheries op. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 progress on the csf is substantial. the amounts actually spent are in line with the forecasts for the first three years. total erdf payments for the first three years amount to ecu 904.5 million, 67% of the commitments. esf commitments for 1996 amount to ecu 321.2 million out of a total of ecu 322.9 million provided for the year. total payments for the three years amount to ecu 846 million, of which ecu 715 million has been spent on the 'human resources' op. the total number of ftfg projects approved represent 53% of the community aid provided for the period 1994-99; the final beneficiaries have spent 31% of the community aid, 22% of which has already been paid to them. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 223 table v-28: ireland - assistance by objective -1996 in the context

ireland: most of the community initiative programmes include aid measures for technological development, but the most substantial amounts are provided by the smes and interreg programmes. the smes programme helps enterprises to enter markets through the creation of data bases and projects to develop new electronic services (ecu 4.7 million; total cost ecu 9.7 million). one of the interreg programmes focuses on developing data transmission applications between ireland and wales to improve information systems covering transport and protection of the marine and coastal environment. the programme also aids innovative technology as part of cultural, tourism and economic cooperation. the programme between ireland and northern ireland made expansion of the digital telecommunications network a priority, together with aid for technological innovation as a necessary tool for managing the programme and achieving its objectives. the programme also provides for a number of r&d measures to improve research capacity and infrastructure in cross-border centres. the leader programme includes measures to encourage access to innovative technology through telecentres, improve enterprises ' and local services ' r&d capabilities and services (ecu 200 000; total cost ecu 600 000), improve data transmission applications (ecu 900 000, total cost ecu 2.2 million) through training in new information technologies, the introduction of computerised reservations systems and telemarketing for tourism, aid for technology transfers and teleworking to create small enterprises and local services, and cross-border operations using innovative technology (teleconferencing, trade, etc.) lastly, the adapt programme devotes 7% of its appropriations to closer linking between smes and research centres so that the centres' activities might be geared better to the needs of industry (ecu 1.4 million; total cost ecu 2.1 million) and, based on the results of some previous projects, the employment initiative provides distance learning for the handicapped through the use of data communications (ecu 1.3 million; total cost ecu 5 million). the last community initiative programme to be approved, urban, was adopted in july 1996. the programme, with a budget of ecu 15.8 million equally divided between the erdf and the esf, involves three urban areas, two in dublin (dublin northside-ballymun and tallaght-west/clondalkin) and one in cork (cork city, northside). the programme is broken down into sub-programmes with equal allocations for each area. the measures concentrate on fostering employment and enterprises, training and education, local infrastructure, young people, the environment and local development. 224 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) on the other hand, the allocation of the reserve for the community initiatives will increase their budget in ireland by ecu 41.7 million. while most of the extra appropriations will be allocated to the leader and employment programmes, some will also go towards adapt, urban, interreg and pesca48. most of the community initiative programmes were amended to take account of indexation for the years 1995 and 1996 and to reprogramme expenditure accordingly. physical implementation of the peace programme speeded up appreciably. the 34 local action groups selected in 1995 for the leader programme are now operating. the pesca programme has helped fund an increase in lobster and mussel stocks. the first call for proposals for the employment initiative resulted in 132 project*; being selected (39 now, 73 horizon and 20 youthstart). the now projects aim especially to reduce women's' under-representation in certain sectors, integrate marginalised women into society and reconcile the competing demands of family and working life. the horizon projects for the handicapped focus on developing in handicapped people the skills to start up a business or develop business acumen. the horizon projects for the disadvantaged seek new ways of reducing the high levels of unemployment, including long-term unemployment, and of meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged. the measures favour the \"bottom-up\" approach, have local-organisation involvement and target a wide variety of beneficiaries (prisoners, young offenders, former prisoners, drug-takers, lone parents, travellers, unqualified young people). lastly, the youthstart project gathers together the various administrative and voluntary services with a view to encouraging integrated local efforts on behalf of unqualified young people below the age of 20 who risk social exclusion. 44 projects have been chosen for the adapt programme covering areas such as improving skills in manufacturing enterprises that have been established for a number of years, the development of information systems, sme products and quality systems, improvements to training systems (technical and pedagogical training for trainers) and the accreditation of continuing vocational training while employed, the creation of jobs in small and micro-enterprises and the development of efficient and practical ways to transfer technology from research institutes to smes. the interim assessments for the interreg, peace, retex, leader and pesca programmes have begun. preparatory work for the other initiatives will follow in 1997. table v-29:

technological potential of the regions of italy: objective 1: technological development plays an important part in most of the priorities in the csf. first of all, under the 'communications' priority, it is concerned with the development of telecommunications (basic telephony, satellite and long distance telecommunications, applications in the public sector - ecu 418 million; total cost: ecu 1 194 million), implemented primarily through the 'telecommunications' op (ecu 376.7 million; total cost: ecu 1 076 million). this will assist in the modernisation of urban networks by using fibre optics and speeding up the digitisation of exchanges, preparing access to the isdn and the development of satellite telecommunications services, giving priority to the establishment of telephone circuits for data transmission, and improving the quality and reliability of services, including connections between exchanges and networks. data transmission applications are included in this programme and specifically in the regional ops (molise: computerisation of the civil service) or in other multiregional ops (road transport infrastructure op: development of a system for the control and automatic monitoring of motorways). rtd is covered by a sub-priority (ecu 975.1 million; total cost: ecu 1 680 million) of the 'infrastructure to support economic activities' priority. the multiregional op implementing it (ecu 784 million; total cost: ecu 1 341 million) includes advanced training, infrastructure for research and the dissemination of innovation. the aim is to develop infrastructure for science faculties and increase the number of students there and to assist research centres controlled by the state (enea, cnr, infn, infm and anton dohrn) while also promoting industrial research, developing the transfer of technology and expanding science and technology parks (mainly to support initiatives by innovative small firms) and financing a large-scale programme to set up science and technology parks in the mezzogiorno. the rtd sub-priority is also being implemented by some of the regional ops: \u0142 apulia: support for research and innovation under the priority for infrastructure to support economic activity; \u0142 campania: development of r&d and science education in universities; \u0142 abruzzi: consolidation of support structures for technological innovation to develop services to industry, craft firms and commerce; \u0142 sicily: expansion of r&d in science, technological innovation and university research infrastructure. the csf priority for industry, craft firms and business services is also intended to expand the provision of real and financial services to innovative firms. in addition, the 'rural development' priority supports research and experimentation to promote agricultural development services and the dissemination of techniques. this priority is implemented both by the multiregional op on 'agricultural dissemination ' and by some regional ops such as that for sicily, which supports the development of agricultural research services, weather forecasting for agriculture, etc. objective 2 (1994-96): all the spds except the one for the valle d'aosta include measures concerned with the dissemination of technologies, innovation or data transmission applications. in some regions, this is a priority which seeks to strengthen innovation-related economic activities: \u0142 emilia-romagna: use of advanced and clean technologies and higher production standards through support for cooperation between firms and research centres and training in innovation for 300 people (ecu 3 million; total cost: ecu 9.7 million); \u0142 friuli-venezia giulia: creation of 30 direct jobs and 150 indirect jobs through the dissemination of innovation and training for qualified staff in the transfer of know-how between firms and research centres in trieste (ecu 2.6 million; total cost: ecu 10.7 million); \u0142 tuscany: promotion and dissemination of innovation between research centres and small industrial firms, assistance for the purchase of technological services and training for the most disadvantaged (ecu 8 million; total cost: ecu 17.3 million); \u0142 piedmont: development of 1 000 firms and creation of 650 jobs through the development of science and research parks, aid for investment by small industrial firms in innovative sectors and training in technology, organisation and quality control (ecu 42.7 million; total cost: ecu 91.6 million); \u0142 liguria: purchase of technological services (feasibility studies, guidance for new projects, etc.), training for workers in research institutes and introduction of short university courses and higher-level specialist courses (ecu 10 million; total cost: ecu 21 millions). although it is not a priority, other regions support innovation as an instrument of industrial conversion: \u0142 lazio: measures to disseminate innovation and to train specialists in the dissemination of scientific and technological knowledge to small firms; \u0142 lombardy: development of advanced technologies in small industrial and craft firms and the 226 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) supply of services for the use of research infrastructure and the transfer of technology (ecu 2.5 million; total cost: ecu 6 million); \u0142 umbria: diversification of the productive base through the promotion and dissemination of innovation and the development of multimedia activities (ecu 3 million; total cost: ecu 6.8 million); \u0142 veneto: establishment of a science and technology park and an intermodal terminal (ecu 6 million; total cost: ecu 19 millions) \u0142 marche: support for telecommunications as part of the development of local intermodal infrastructure. total expenditure on technological development under the regional objectives (1, 2, 5(b)) accounts for 11,7% of structural fund assistance in italy. table v-30: italy - financing

structural funds in italy, the accent in 1996 was on continuation and improvement of the approach which had led to the july 1995 agreement between the commission and the italian administration49. this resulted in better monitoring instruments and it was agreed to adopt a two-stage method for reprogramming the csf. the first phase comprises very close monitoring of the assistance adopted and will conclude towards the end of the first quarter of the following year. to achieve this, small working parties were set up for each op and they are meeting regularly. the second phase, based on the progress of expenditure and commitments on the ground, will permit a possible redistribution of the resources already allocated to the initiatives decided on in 1994-97. in addition, because of delays in implementation, it 49 see 1995 annual rapport. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996} 227 was agreed to increase the monitoring instruments, including the number of meetings of the csf monitoring committee, which met on three occasions during the year. apart from this reprogramming methodology, the main horizontal subjects considered throughout 1996 were the introduction of an appropriate system for physical monitoring, the allocation of indexation, specific attention to raising awareness on environmental issues and monitoring the additionality of the structural funds. the commission also adopted five new operations during 1996, two regional global grants (crotone and manfredonia) and three multiregional ops (two financed by the erdf and one by the eaggf). the crotone global grant is unusual in that it is a sort of territorial pact, with local people deeply involved in both programming and the management of measures. the 'road transport infrastructure' op was also approved in 19^6; it provides ecu 249 million towards a total cost of ecu 498 million. the 'energy' op (ecu 170 million from the erdf) includes a series of measures for the gas network and. to improve the electricity grid. the 'services for the commercial exploitation of southern agricultural production' op, with ecu 72 million from the eaggf, was adopted in october 1996; it will initiate measures to organise and concentrate the supply of agricultural products with due regard to market requirements. in the case of the programmes already being implemented, and specifically those financed by the eaggf, work began on information, organisation and the selection of projects under the regional ops once the national laws on part-financing had been approved in the first half of 1996. a very large number of applications were made. in campania, for example, publication of the programme resulted in the submission of 23 000 projects. about 70% of appropriations have already been committed by the regional administration. the main effort with regard to actual payments has concentrated on those programmes which can make up the backlog in applying regulation (eec) no 2328/91 and other regulations of long standing. the main measures were the payment of the compensatory allowance to farmers in disadvantaged areas and the citrus fruit plan in sicily and calabria. it should prove possible in future to respect the annual nature of payments of compensatory allowances more fully. two programmes are planned at multiregional level. the first is intended to enlarge the body of field workers available in each region and cover salary costs for the first six years following their recruitment. the second is the programme adopted in 1996 for services to develop southern products, which assists the setting up of new companies (large-scale commercial bodies) involving producers, hauliers and distributors to improve conditions for the marketing and development of quality products in the fruit and vegetables, olive oil and horticulture sectors. in the case of fisheries, the measures in the op which have proved most capable of absorbing appropriations have been adaptation of the fishing effort (particularly the measure to promote joint ventures) and fleet modernisation. the commission adopted 18 amending decisions, five of which concerned the abruzzi region, which was eligible under objective 1 only in 1994-96 and applied for a two-year extension of national corrrrnitments and payments. the decision-making procedure began in 1996. to take account of the particular situation of this region, which will cease to benefit from structural fund assistance after 1997, the csf monitoring committee decided that ecu 25 million of the amount made available by-indexation of the csf should be allocated to the region of abruzzi. of that amount, an extra ecu 10 million from the eaggf enabled measures for which a large number of applications had been received to be honoured. the financing plans were formally amended in the light of the time for implementation available. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 at the end of 1996, the financial situation of the csf was critical, since commitments actually made amounted to 41% of total commitments, while payments stood at 17%. in the case of the erdf, commitments totalled 41% while payments amounted to 31% of total erdf funding for the different forms of assistance. at the end of 1996, resources available but not yet committed by the erdf totalled ecu 1 537 million. similarly, eaggf appropriations committed up to the end of 1996 represented 25% of the appropriations planned for 1994-99 and payments made to 13%. in the case of the esf, commitments were around 41% and payments 16% of the total cost. this backlog in commitments and payments is partly due to long than expected delays in approving programmes. ?3 \u00ebarta the structural funds in 1996 228 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) since the vast bulk of assistance has now been approved, delays in implementation should be made up in the second part of the period. eligible expenditure incurred by final beneficiaries under the fifg amounted to ecu 15.8 million, about 7% of eligible costs programmed for 1994-99. the main feature of 1997 should be continuation of the approach followed since 1995 and improved monitoring instruments. objective 250 fie. v-35: proerammine 1994-96 (ecu million - 1996 prices and status): breakdown bv sector: productive environment (a) human resources (b) land improvement and

the amount involved was ecu 169.7 million (after indexation), 25% of the ecu 693.7 million available. the ability of the regions to commit the appropriations varied. only one region, emilia-romagna, succeeded in committing virtually all the appropriations for 1994-96 while for the other regions, transfers ranged from 9% of the initial assistance (lazio) to 51% (umbria). for the most part, it was the resources for infrastructure which had to be transferred while the vast bulk of those for aid schemes, services to small firms, economic development and the transfer of technology were committed in full. in some regions, the situation with regard to the payments made by the various authorities responsible improved considerably as compared with 1995 (for example, valle d'aosta: 53%; piedmont: 33%; tuscany: 30%). the monitoring committees met regularly in 1996, dealing mainly with the monitoring bf implementation, reprograrnming and the selection of independent assessors responsible for interim and ex post evaluations. the partnership dialogue between the commission, the central government and the regional authorities remained satisfactory. the economic and social partners continued to play an active role in meetings as full members of the monitoring committees. 50 eligible areas: emilia-romagna, friuli-venezia giulia, lazio, liguria, lombardy, marche, umbria, piedmont, tuscany, valle d'aosta, veneto. 51 the programmes for the previous period 1992-93 (ecu 183 million: ecu 127 million from the erdf and ecu 56 million from the esf) were closed in 1996 because extensions to the deadlines for payments at regional level had been granted as part of the agreement between the commission and italy on ways of improving the management of the structural funds. certificates of final payment are still awaited for most programmes, but payments should amount to 75% of the total funds available. this under-implementation is due mainly to the problems encountered during implementation. this is particularly true of infrastructure projects, where a difficult political situation has further complicated the administrative procedures. other problems have been caused by the blockage of certain projects for which appropriations had been committed and the devaluation of the lira. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996} 229 preparations for the 1997-99 programming period the areas of italy eligible for the 1997-99 phase are broadly unchanged, the only major adjustment being the addition of three municipalities in the area of ferrara (emilia-romagna). including transfers from 1994-96, the resources available total ecu 967.5 million52. the draft spds were submitted by the italian authorities in august 1996. although the strategies very largely continue those followed in 1994-96, they reflect the commission's guidelines. resources will be concentrated mainly on the development and strengthening of small firms, support for innovation and the transfer of technology, tourism, local employment initiatives and the protection of the environment. there will also be specific training measures. preparatory meetings involving the commission, the national authorities and the regions were held from november onwards, to define more closely the strategies, aims and, in some cases, the structure of the proposed programmes.

regional and multi-regional ops adopted in december 1994. the rates of financial implementation are unsatisfactory, which suggests that normal implementation has not yet been achieved. in order to make better use of resources and explore new forms of programming, the italian government decided in 1996 to undertake a substantial mid-term reprogramming. hence a new multiregional op, to be adopted in 1997 for a period of three years and forming part of the confidence pact for employment, will receive ecu 27.1 million from the esf. the way this op is financed includes an innovation in that it will receive the resources allocated to the current regional and multiregional ops and not committed by the end of 1997, 1998 and 1999. the ministry of labour will be responsible for coordination, monitoring and assessment but the regions will be responsible for implementing the measures. the internal assessment report prepared by the ministry of labour has some encouraging features such as a positive assessment of the training system and the skill level of young people (measures for young people are moving towards training which is increasingly based on activities of the upper secondary type), and the sound use of the resources allocated to training in equal opportunities and for the socially marginalised. there is, however, a substantial shortfall in the utilisation of the appropriations for the long-term unemployed. 52 emilia-romagna: ecu 14.1 million; friuli-venezia giulia: ecu 39.2 million; lazio: ecu 76.9 million; liguria: ecu 129.5 million; lombardy: ecu 34

objective 4 comprises an spd adopted in december 1994 for 1994 to 1999. the low level of financial implementation for 1996 may be explained partly by delays in making available national matching funds (from both public and private sources). italy also suffers from a lack of ongoing training for workers, which means that there are very few structures which can provide support for firms. hence the spd has made very little progress in anticipating change. however, more assistance has been provided for training, guidance and advisory services and the absorption of funds is greater. during 1995 and the first half of 1996, there were 4 071 projects in these fields but only 125 concerned with anticipating change. most bodies which prepare training projects are in the public sector while the bulk of firms proposing projects are small ones. these projects are aimed at the most vulnerable workers and training concentrates on new ways of organising work. the commission has asked for a specific analysis of the projects carried out by firms. example of an objective 4 project in italy : multimedia and distance training in emilia-romagna: the sinform project is designed to establish a data transmission network to distribute multimedia products and training services on the methodology of distance training. this is also the key point of certain existing distance training networks in the rest of the community. the aim of the project is to establish a regional network covering the nine provinces of emilia-romagna and including a multimedia centre with nine offices and 66 computers, a library of multimedia educational software and tests involving 200 instructors and organisers of european projects. the esf will contribute ecu 550 000 in part-financing towards the total cost of ecu 1.44 million. it is expected that 1 500 people will be trained over the period as a whole. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-31: proerammine 1994-99 (ecu million -1996 prices and status) total

eligible costs for 1994-99. the 1994 instalment has not yet been closed because the annual reports on implementation have not been submitted. the first instalments for 1995 were paid at the end of 1996 and it has not proved possible to commit the two instalments for 1996. the level of commitments by the italian authorities is, however, much higher than the level of payments. this means that, since projects can be carried over a period not exceeding three years, the absorption of appropriations by beneficiaries during 1997 will probably increase. objective 5(b)53 fie. v-39: obiective 5(b)-

same point in the previous prograrriming period, is the result of the complexity of the implementation procedures. the special features of the italian administrative system often mean that between 12 and 24 months elapse before programmes can actually start. by mid-1996, the italian programmes had got over the administrative hurdle and were being fully implemented in \"physical\" terms. commitments rose substantially in the second half of 1996. in terms of the resources programmed for 1994-96, appropriations committed increased from 14% at the end of june to 56% at the end of the year although payments remain at a low level. however, the regions and provinces have offset delays in the payment procedures by advances to the final beneficiaries in the form of bank guarantees. as regards programme monitoring, during the first half of the year the monitoring committees concentrated mainly on three types of activity: adjustments to certain elements of programming in the light of new territorial requirements (10 of the 13 spds); implementing technical assistance for programme implementation; and arrangements for monitoring and evaluation (the interim assessment reports will be completed by mid-june 1997). in the second half of the year, the committees were more concerned with assessing the impact of measures, particularly in terms of jobs. 53 areas eligible: emilia-romagna,

implemented through non-regionalised programmes. in 1994 and 1995, 21 cips were adopted for the initiatives rechar, retex (amendment of the cip adopted in 1993), adapt, leader, pesca and the regen strand of interreg. the leader (10), urban, r\u00e9sider, smes and konver programmes which remained were adopted in 1996, as were five interreg cips (three with france, one with albania and one with switzerland). support for the development of technological potential in italy: the smes programme provides ecu 31 million (total cost: ecu 87.9 million) to help small firms define their priorities for technological innovation, to promote cooperation between small firms and research centres, to encourage the development of networks to exchange rtd know-how, and to encourage the use of advanced telecommunications systems to diversif}' production and market opportunities. most of the interreg programmes include measures relating to transfers of innovation and technology to local 234 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) small firms (ecu 4.6 million; total cost: ecu 13.8 million) and the development of data transmission networks (ecu 2.4 million; total cost: ecu 5.1 million). furthermore, the programme with greece is intended to develop in italy the advanced telecommunications infrastructure required to connect the two countries ' networks (ecu 8.5 million). in the field of human resources, the adapt programme seeks to make use of the new technologies while taking account of industrial changes and the new employment opportunities (in the audio-visual sector, information and communications technology, etc.) and stimulate new methods of training such as distance learning. the employment cip concentrates on new specialisations, particularly in rtd and innovation, the management of firms or cooperatives, and the training of instructors. it promotes synergies with measures under the community framework research programmes in the fields of information technologies and communications such as flexible learning, distance learning and data transmission applications for the handicapped (e.g. the tide programme). the leader programmes too provide support for distance learning and work, the promotion of rural tourism and reservation systems using multimedia or data transmission applications (ecu 6 million; total cost: ecu 13 millions), and transfers of innovation and technology to local firms. the rechar and r\u00e9sider cips include measures to support technological innovation and the urban programme offers support in a number of italian towns for projects relating to the use of training services or information by data transmission. the commission approved 14 new programmes in italy and five interreg programmes. these include the smes clp, a single programme for all the eligible areas, to which the structural funds will contribute ecu 191.7 million. this programme includes provision for assistance to improve services to firms in the fields of quality and innovation and to improve access by small firms to finance and the capital markets. the r\u00e9sider programme affects nine regions; the erdf will provide ecu 85.6 million. the priority areas for assistance are the improvement of the environment where it has deteriorated (47%), the promotion of new economic activities to stimulate diversification (33%) and help in the development of tourist activities (4%). the konver programme (ecu 46.1 million from the erdf) is mainly devoted to the promotion of replacement economic activities, and in particular the establishment and development of small firms (68%) and the improvement and restoration of military areas and areas seriously affected by military activity (15%). for example, it is banned to provide assistance in apulia to support services to small firms in the fields of the environment, environmental quality (the ecolabel) and workers' safety. the urban cip covers 13 municipalities (rome, genoa, venice, all of which are outside objective 1, and naples, salerno, palermo, catania, siracusa, reggio calabria, cosenza, bari, foggia and cagliari, which are eligible under objective 1). in five towns, assistance will concentrate on the suburbs and in eight on the historic centre. each town will manage its own sub-programme and management is decentralised to local level. the largest number of clps adopted in 1996 was under the leader initiative (total assistance ecu 105.5 million). approval of the leader programmes was thus completed in 1996 with the adoption of seven programmes for the objective 5(b) areas and two for the objective 1 areas (molise and sicily). there are intended to provide extra funding for rural development to complement measures financed under the objective 1 ops. priority was given to the areas with greatest difficulties, those with hilly and mountainous terrain. in the case of the objective 5(b) areas, selection of the local action groups at regional level proved particularly complex (selection is based on quantified qualitative criteria, intended principally to ensure a satisfactory territorial concentration) and by the end of the year had been completed in three regions or autonomous provinces (8 groups selected), while the procedure was in its final phase in six other regions. in the objective 1 regions, the groups had been selected in calabria, the abruzzi and, in part, campania. selection by the other regions is in progress. technical assistance to launch the national network of leader groups was also approved in 1996. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 235 five interreg programmes were approved in 1996. the sardinia-corsica programme concerns the province of sassari in sardinia and the department of corse du sud and includes assistance for communications between the two islands and environmental protection.. the corsica-tuscany programme concerns the department of haute corse and the province of livorno. its priorities for assistance include tourism, sea transport and communications infrastructure, the transfer of technology and economic and cultural exchanges between the two areas. on the franco-italian border, the alpes cip concerns the alpine regions (rh\u00f4ne-alpes, provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d'azur; valle d'aosta, piedmont, liguria). the priority sectors for assistance are improving communications between frontier areas, promoting the cultural heritage of these areas and encouraging economic activity on the border. the italo-swiss cip concerns the frontier areas of the valle d'aosta, piedmont, lombardy and the province of bolzano. assistance is intended to improve cooperation between small firms, infrastructure, the development of agricultural, forestry and fisheries production and the development of the natural, historical and cultural heritage. the programme involving italy and albania concerns the areas on the sea frontier between the two countries (apulia in italy) and complements the italy/albania phare programme for 1995-99, which covers the coastal areas of albania. the programme's resources are concentrated on a limited number of fields: transport and communications (improving port systems and telecommunications), cooperation among small firms, tourism and the environment. during 1996, negotiations between the authorities concerned continued on one interreg programme, the greece-italy clp (approval and effective implementation were expected in 1997). another important feature of 1996 was the commission decision on allocation of the reserve, which provided an additional ecu 199 million for italy. this amount went mainly to the employment, leader, interreg ii c, adapt, urban and konver initiatives54. the programmes which benefited from the reserve will be the subject of fresh programming or integration in 1997. implementation of most of the programmes was subject to substantial delays. in view of the late approval of the various programmes (end 1995 and 1996), 1996 was mainly devoted to establishing the monitoring committees and to the adoption, at national level, of procedures for the approval and implementation of the various projects. as a result the financial results of implementation for 1996 are only slight. all the monitoring committees for the initiatives approved in 1996 were set up. for some programmes (retex, interreg italy-france (corsica-sardinia), interreg italy-albania, urban), proposals for amendments intended to bring the terms of programming more closely into line with actual progress and with the expected use of resources were considered. in the case of the pesca programme, which is not managed entirely at central level, since it comprises 11 regional sub-programmes and two multi-area sub-programmes, with some sub-programmes managed by the national administration and others by the regional administrations, this division of management between administrations caused difficulties of coordination. while the first advance (50%) of the 1995 instalment (fifg and erdf) was paid by the commission, no expenditure was incurred by the beneficiaries, even though in the case of some sub-programmes the projects had already been selected (mainly where the sub-programmes were managed by the central administration). under employment, 234 projects (197 regional and 37 multi-regional: 52 youthstart, 67 now, 115 horizon) have been financed since 1994. the projects under youthstart concern the training of instructors and the creation of jobs in growth sectors such as the environment, the cultural heritage and tourism. the main aim of the now projects is to help with the establishment of firms. the projects under horizon-handicapped (71 projects) provide specific training for the disabled while those under horizon-disadvantaged (44 projects) focus on training and integration into the labour market. the main aim of the adapt programme is to assist the national plan to establish an on-going training system. since 1995, 182 projects have been selected, of which 141 are regional and 41 multi-regional. most projects relate to the training of the staff of firms, many of which are in the services sector (tourism and the environment). 54 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 236 8th annual repon on the structural funds (1996) table v-33 : italy - community initiatives - 1996 in the

implementation of assistance bv objective in 1996 support for the development of the technological potential of the regions of luxembourg: objective 2 (1994-96): the strategy of the spd for the conversion of the traditional metal-working industry to the electrical sector gave priority to the industrial sector, partly through measures to promote technological innovation. this involves not only support for rtd, particularly materials analysis (including the promotion of transfers of technology between research centres and firms), but also technical and scientific assistance to firms and the training of staff in rtd. objective 5(b): the development of the new technologies is supported by the spd as a means of giving fresh life to rural areas by reducing the distance between work and home, so making countrydwellers economically independent and keeping them in rural areas, by improving day-to-day living conditions, and through the protection and safeguarding of the countryside. measures therefore support rtd in small industrial, commercial and craft firms and in administrations which wish to establish local offices in rural areas. total support for technological development accounts for 13.2% of the appropriations under objective 2. table v-34: luxembourg - financing directly linked to technological development in 1994-96 (ecu million) _________ total 2a 100% s.f jlz __l

human resources, to which the esf will now contribute ecu 194 000. because of the low level of commitments at the end of 1996, the community contribution has been reduced to ecu 5.3 million and ecu 1.8 million (25% of the original assistance, including indexation) has been transferred to 1997-99 because of under-utilisation by the measure to promote productive investment (aid scheme for firms)

structural funds (1996) 9.2. implementation of the community initiatives in 1996 note: luxembourg does not participate in four of the initiatives: rechar, retex, regis and pesca. five cips were adopted in 1994 and 1995 (employment, urban, adapt, leader, interreg). one interreg programme with belgium and france was still to be approved and this was done in 1996. three national programmes still to be approved concerned smes (adopted in 1996), r\u00e9sider and konver. ; support for the development of the technological potential of luxembourg: support for technological development plays a comparatively large role in the smes and interreg 11 community initiatives. the. smes cip finances measures of two types to promote rtd to increase the international competitiveness of small firms. these are respect for the environment through the sound management of resources and the use of clean technologies, and the promotion of strategic management in small firms through the development of information systems on public contracts, communications in the construction sector, etc. the interreg 11 programme between luxembourg and germany encourages the transfer of technology (ecu 1.6 million: total cost: ecu 3.1 million) and the establishment of cooperation networks. the programme involving luxembourg, wallonia and lorraine contains, among the measures likely to introduce new technologies, the creation of structures to provide information and support to small firms and the development of human resources through the adjustment of training to meet the needs of local industry and the setting up of information networks. two new community initiative programmes were approved in 1996. the first, adopted in september 1996, is the smes cip for areas eligible under objectives 2 and 5(b). community assistance will provide 25% of the total investment planned. the main measures are based on two priorities, encouraging small craft and industrial firms to take account of the environment and promoting strategic management in small firms. an interreg programme covering luxembourg, belgium and france was also approved in february. it embraces the districts of arlon, virton, bastogne and neufch\u00e2teau in belgium, the departments of meuse, meurthe-et-moselle and moselle in france, and all of luxembourg. the programme has four priorities: cross-border economic development (provision of venture capital for small firms on a cross-border basis; premises for firms; the development of locally-generated potential); the development of human resources (european technology college); the attractiveness and environment of the cross-border area (design and implementation of cross-border facilities for waste management; establishment of local partnerships in the countryside; improving water and river quality); and cross-border urban development (town planning, structuring cross-border urban areas). the first meeting of the monitoring committee was held in november. the arrangements for monitoring the programme were approved (rules of procedure, organisation plan for implementing the programme, selection criteria) and a number of projects were considered (study on the exploitation of cross-border aquifers, study on preventing flooding of the chiers, etc.). the commission was unable to approve the joint resider/konver programme submitted by the luxembourg authorities. a number of essential points such as a description of the measures were missing from the latest version of the programme received on 9 february 1996. despite the conrrnission's repeated requests, the luxembourg authorities did not submit a new version during 1996. turning to the programmes already implemented, the employment and adapt cips made satisfactory progress during 1996. these initiatives are financing three and two projects respectively, all for a four-year period. under employment, the youthstart project seeks to identify young people who have not succeeded in the education system and offer them, through guidance and counselling, a recognised vocational qualification. the horizon project tries to create jobs for the disadvantaged in horticulture (establishment of a company to maintain open spaces), and the now project offers integrated training to women seeking to re-enter the labour market. the adapt project provides training and advice to firms and is establishing a data base containing information for workers on the on-going training available. as for the new integra strand of the employment initiative, for which luxembourg has 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 241 been allocated no extra finance, in 1996 luxembourg proposed a draft in the form of a pilot project under article 6 of the esf regulation. implementation of leader is proceeding satisfactorily. following the decision on the allocation of the reserve for the community initiatives, luxembourg received ecu 1.23 million which will go to the r\u00e9sider and leader initiatives57. table v-37: luxembourg - community initiatives - 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 (ecu million) initiative (number or cips) adapt

support for the development of technological potential in theregions of the netherlands: objective 1: the flevoland spd allocates ecu 14.4 million (total cost: ecu 86.9 million) to assisting rtd in four spheres : \u0142 the \"regional technology plan \" which combines increasing regional rtd capacity with working towards the region's socio-economic objectives (ecu 0.2 million): \u0142 creating a technology transfer centre to assist smes and a network of regional telecommunications centres (ecu 1.5 million): \u0142 the kim project, which helps businesses employ people with university backgrounds and highly qualified staff in order to introduce new technologies and new working methods into business and industry (hydraulics, water resource management, environmental aspects, industrial hydrodynamics, development of coastal areas, fire prevention, etc. - ecu 0.2 million); \u0142 building new applied research infrastructures and providing industry with financial assistance for r&d (ecu 12.5 million). rtd is also a key factor in the strategy for modernising agriculture (ecu 5.6 million; total cost: ecu 23.2 million). the spd encourages the concentration and extension of high-level rtd through relocations and the creation of research institutes (e.g.: the lelystad 1dl-dlo research centre, creating 250 posts for highly qualified staff), the diversification of their activities and the development of a centre to facilitate the transfer of research results to the agri-industrial sector and to farms. the spd also provides support for fisheries research (ecu 1.1 million; total cost: ecu 20.7 million). objective 2 (1994-96): the objective 2 spds devote 10% of the structural fund contribution to rtd. the measures are intended to strengthen the industrial fabric by stimulating product innovation and development, more specifically: \u0142 arnhem-nijmegen: sites for business and industry (the mercator science and technology park in nijmegen, the hbo-bedrijfscentrum in arnhem, the bedrijvencentrum simon stevin in arnhem): development of industrial structures and expertise (business clusters - e.g.: a business collaboration project in the silver-plated goods industry; promotion of innovation and quality (e.g.: medical technology; new business activities, etc.), investment in human capital (ecu 6.9 million in total; total cost: ecu 25.6 million); \u0142 groningen-drenthe: encouragement of technological innovation, assistance for rtd, guidance on the application of environmental technologies, creation of a technological development centre (ecu 0.5 million; total cost: ecu 1.2 million); \u0142 twente-overijssel: development of technological infrastructures and expertise (ecu 1.8 million; total cost: ecu 5.3 million) and support for innovation (ecu 0.5 million; total cost: ecu 1.1 million) - e.g.: technology institutes in the business and science park; \u0142 south limburg: development of products, business sites and environmental technologies and high-level training in technology (ecu 8.2 million; total cost: ecu 25 million); \u0142 south east brabant: equipping research centres (ecu 9.7 million; total cost: ecu 39.7 million), improving technological training and the transfer of expertise to new businesses. apart from rtd. the programmes are devoting 1.5% to telecommunications, specifically linking up with the telecommunication networks and basic infrastructure and equipment. only the twente spd makes more precise provision, for the construction of a cable link in the business and science park and the establishment of a data transmission study centre to develop multi-modal transport in the region. as for data transmission applications, the twente spd is providing support for the development of data transmission applied to transport and groningen-drenthe is supporting the creation of a data transmission development centre. objective 5(b): in friesland research and information centres are being developed and technology transfer in the context of business development will be facilitated. in groningen-drenthe priority is being given to developing business clusters with the help of a grant of ecu 7.3 million (total cost: ecu 32.9 million), as well as support for new products and technologies and informing businesses about innovation. in overijssel it is planned to develop data transmission services and research projects and develop new products in the context of developing natural resources and agriculture. in total. community financing for technological development in the netherlands accounts for 13.2% of structural fund appropriations (objectives 1 and 2). 8th annual report on the structural fund'; (1996) 243 table v-38: netherlands - financing directly related to technological

growth 3% higher than the national average and an unemployment rate below the national average and reducing disparities in unemployment rates within the region. not all of these goals have yet been achieved. per capita gdp is catching up with the national average and employment growth is almost 3% higher than the national rate, but for the first time unemployment in flevoland is slightly higher than the average for the netherlands and unemployment disparities within the region increased between 1994 and 1995. among the main points to be noted concerning the implementation of the spd in 1996, the first is the introduction of subject-based meetings to stimulate open discussion between the partners on specific subjects such as, in 1996, fostering job creation, interim assessment, agricultural policy, and the regional technology plan. secondly, flevoland is one of the regions participating in the territorial employment pacts. the region drafted an action plan called \"action for employment\", which follows the lines of the objective 1 spd but stresses the need for greater coordination of the various regional partners on the basis of three principles: dynamism, creativity and synergy, the aim being to achieve coherence between existing projects rather than launch new ones. the impact on employment of projects already approved is estimated as follows: 10 492 permanent jobs (6 749 created directly and 3 743 indirectly) and 2 793 temporary jobs. the implementation of the various measures meant that the 1995 instalment could be paid out and that for 1994 closed. the following measures are progressing satisfactorily: support for business and 58 eligible area: flevoland. 244 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) industry (particularly smes) and transport infrastructure (the main project is the conversion of road no 27 into a motorway (the a27), which will improve flevoland's links with the centre and south of the country; work on this project is up to schedule). in other areas (fisheries, business infrastructures and research and development) progress is slower. on the other hand, the regional technology plan has given rise to an increased number of research and development projects. measures relating to fisheries are proceeding as forecast, beginning with the implementation of the measure to adjust fishing effort by the permanent decommissioning of vessels; measures relating to product processing and marketing have now also been launched. in the case of the 'agriculture and rural development' priority, apart from measures under objective 5(a), the measures financed by the eaggf are essentially to assist agricultural research, sustainable farming, new agricultural activities and water management. all these measures are considerably behindhand with their financial implementation because of long gaps between legal and budget commitments and payments. so at the end of 1996 only two of the six annual instalments had been committed, i.e. 30% of the appropriations provided for. a discussion day on farming in flevoland was organized and measures to accelerate implementation have been taken. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 the mid-term assessment report was submitted by the assessor. its main conclusions were that the structure, strategy and coherence of the programme are still sound but organisation and management could be better integrated. it also recommends a greater concentration of effort on certain areas, in particular combating unemployment, diversification in areas dependent on fisheries and creating centres of activity in certain sectors such as the food industry, transport and distribution, the media, tourism and leisure. generally speaking it may be said that the spd has helped to improve cooperation between the various partners in a region which has not traditionally had cooperative networks. the operation of the monitoring committee has been improved, in particular by introducing subject-based meetings, which have drawn many participants; of the eligible dutch regions, only flevoland has taken this particular initiative. objective 259 fie v-tt-

1996 that the systems for monitoring the different spds became fully operational, enabling all financial information and indicators to be transmitted in detail. each programme developed in different ways: \u0142 in groningen-drenthe two measures - the regional technology plan and measures relating to the environment and energy - were completed and will serve as a basis for the next phase, while the measure assisting businesses with advice, internationalisation, technology and investment were a marked success and had to be allocated additional funding. however, there was some difficulty in engaging the interest of the final beneficiaries of the programme, mainly because of the diversity of administrative procedures involved; \u0142 under the twente programme, the commission approved two venture capital funds as well as the regional technology plan which serves as a framework for the selection of technological projects. in this programme, several measures - a multi-mode transport infrastructure project and an industrial infrastructure project, financed by the erdf and transport, distribution and tourism projects financed by the esf - are encountering difficulties,, whereas the esf measure to assist industry is making rapid progress. the assessment concludes that employment in industry is continuing to fall, but that the measures to assist industry and help develop businesses, which are working well, could help to slow down this decline; \u0142 the rate of implementation in arnhem-nijmegen is explained by the fact that some measures are late (in particular, tourism and esf measures). strategies for assisting industry and tourism were improved, but it was noted that sectoral and semi-public organisations needed to participate more actively; \u0142 in the case of south east brabant, esf financing was almost fully used in 1996 and erdf measures to assist industrial sites, business parks and the working environment progressed well, while those to assist tourism and technology and training centres were not so successful. the assessment shows that the objectives of the programmes should be achieved, that the programme schedule was complied with, there were no difficulties with monitoring or part-financing, smes were effectively informed and the first finalised esf projects enabled 86% of the unemployed who had taken part in training to find a job; \u0142 in south limburg the programme was adjusted firstly because of indexation, with the resulting amount being allocated to measures to assist tourism and technical assistance (adaptation of the monitoring system), and secondly because of the amounts not used by the measures to assist industry and create new companies were transferred to the tourism measure; the transfer is to be compensated for in the 1997-99 programme. preparation of the 1997-99 programming period preparation of the 1997-99 programming period began in the second half of 1996. each of the projects submitted follows on from measures in the 1994-96 programming period, but with some modification of the priorities. for example, the draft spd for groningen-drenthe places greater emphasis on local employment initiatives, the economic importance of certain towns and the regional technology plan, and less on infrastructure. similarly, the quality of life and the local economy as well as employment initiatives have been added to the priorities in south east brabant. investment in twente will be more focused than in the past on future-oriented sectors capable of creating jobs and diversifying the regional economy, which means that more financing will be going to assist productive infrastructure, technology and industry. similarly, the emphasis of the arnhem-nijmegen draft programme will be shifting from economic infrastructures towards businesses and information technology. 246 8th annual report on the structural fund<: (1996) objectives 3 and 4 fie. v-47: obiective 3 - proerammine 1994-99 (ecu

training, 6 460 receiving counselling and 47 540 participating in reintegration projects). expenditure tends to concentrate more on the reintegration projects than on counselling. this reflects the tendency of employment services to seek individual approaches to assist the unemployed and the prograrriming for the following years may be officially changed to reflect this shift during the mid-term review. in 1996 esf financing of the traineeship system was also extended; this system offers training in the work place, work experience and one day of theoretical training per week. the esf is also organising ways of matching supply and demand for trainees by region and by sector, which will make it possible to place an additional four to five thousand young trainees every year. financial implementation was rather less good than in previous years because of the time it takes for the regional employment offices to submit projects under the esf pan-financing system. the allocation of certain budgets to a particular promoter has meant that in certain cases they have remained unused if the promoter did not succeed in organising the project. the cost of the projects seems to have slightly increased because unemployment has fallen in the netherlands and so greater effort is now required to help those who remain unemployed. fie. v-48: objective 4 - proerammine 1994-99 (ecu

is estimated that 41 000 people received training under these projects, with 25 000 of them working in smes. of the programme's three priorities, the most financing goes to the third priority, training. it seems that forecasting labour market trends and the development of training programmes is already well developed in the netherlands. under the 'anticipation' priority, an employment monitoring system was set up, which has already worked effectively in the coordination of existing efforts and which will examine trends in supply and demand on the labour market and establish whether the objective 4 programme is in step with these trends. this programme is already well known to the target group and is finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the large number of project proposals. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 241 objective 5(a) agriculture table v-59: proerammine 1994-99 (ecu million \u0142 1994 prices): total 118,0 measure production 78.8 39.2

from 918 in 1993 and 883 in 1994 to 226 in 1995. this fall is attributed to the \"wait-and-see\" attitude of the dutch agricultural sector as a result of trends in agricultural income. this is reflected in the downward revision of expenditure for 1995 (- 43% compared to the forecasts made in 1994). since 1993, setting-up aid fqr young farmers has no longer been provided. the spd for product processing and marketing began as programmed. most of the projects are innovative or have an environmental emphasis. for the sake of simplicity, in 1996 the netherlands proposed integrating the

initiatives. twelve ceps (community initiative programmes) at national level were adopted in 1994 and 1995 for all the initiatives, to which 7 interreg ceps should be added. at the end of 1995, only the konver cip remained to be adopted, and this was approved in 1996. support for the development of technological potential in the netherlands : most of the dutch cips contain measures to support technological development. in this respect, the smes programme provides not only for the development of telecommunications as a basic factor in the constitution of networks between businesses, but also, on the rtd side, several measures to promote the introduction of new procedures, techniques and products, as well as cooperation with research centres (e.g. open days, exchange projects, training on the job) and the transfer of technology. furthermore, one of the programme's strands focuses on new information systems, aiming to introduce new technologies into businesses. under interreg, certain programmes have introduced support measures for telecommunications. some programmes involving the netherlands and germany give priority to the reinforcement of telecommunications infrastructure, as is also the case for the netherlands and belgium, to provide connections with the trans-european electronic networks. on the rtd side, cooperation programmes between the netherlands and belgium and the netherlands, belgium and germany provide support for cooperation between businesses and research centres, as well as technology transfer to stimulate innovation and the modernisation of production procedures and products. in the case of the industrial conversion initiatives, in ijmond r\u00e9sider is promoting new technologies and industrial development as well as nerworks in the industrial and service sectors, with the help of a grant of ecu 3.7 million (iota! cost: ecu 9. j million) for business innovation and creation. the retex programme is 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 249 also providing support for technological development and innovation in the twente region. under the employment, initiative, the horizon strand facilitates the integration of handicapped people and disadvantaged groups into the labour market through the development of distance working and the introduction of flexible training systems such as distance learning and interactive education. the konver cep was finally adopted by the commission in march 1996. it covers eight dutch regions (kop van noord-holand, the hague/delft, rijnmond, walcheren, part of the province of utrecht, veluwe, amhem/nijmegen and north west brabant), and focuses mainly on the conversion of defence-related industries, the stimulation of innovation, the revitalisation of industrial sites, the development of tourism and training. the decision on the allocation of the community initiative reserve will give this programme an extra ecu 15.1 million and extends it to 1999. 49% of the first advance has already been allocated to projects by the dutch authorities and the programme is arousing great interest, with a large number of applications by project managers. the corrtmission's decision on the community initiatives will give an extra ecu 184.55 million to the netherlands. apart from the sum allocated to konver, this amount has been distributed among the adapt, employment, leader, pesca, r\u00e9sider, urban and interreg initiatives62. in the case of interreg li c, under the flood prevention strand, the netherlands will receive ecu 100 million to implement a programme in the meuse-rhine basin. this programme was drawn up at the end of 1996 in cooperation with the belgian, german, french, and luxembourg authorities and will have a structural funds package of ecu 135 million at its disposal (in addition to the sum allocated to the netherlands, the package is distributed as follows: belgium: ecu 7.5 million; germany: 24.9 million; france: 2.6 million; no budget for luxembourg). as regards existing programmes, the r\u00e9sider (ijmond) programme wjll be extended to 1999 and allocated an additional ecu 5 million from the reserve. the programme is succeeding well: at the end of 1996, 70% of the structural funds package was committed to projects and the total cost will rise from ecu 50 million to ecu 100 million because national, regional and private part-financing will be higher than initially envisaged. the aid scheme for advice for smes has been particularly successful, especially because of the great demand for iso certifications, which has meant that funding for this measure has had to be doubled. the retex initiative has been integrated as a measure under the objective 2 spd for twente to encourage smes to innovate, and it has already paid out 50% of its allocation. the smes cep started up in 1996 and 65% of its annual instalment for 1996 was committed to projects, which means that it is behind schedule. there are, however, considerable differences from measure to measure: the measures to assist technology projects, exchanges of experience and the networking of demonstration projects are going well, while others such as demonstration centres, rtd centres and the introduction of new technologies in smes, still need more work. under the urban initiative the two first programmes - for amsterdam and the hague - started up relatively late because of hesitations by the dutch authorities about which cities to choose. in 1996 important work was done under the amsterdam programme. the dutch authorities also decided to allocate an additional ecu 13.1 million from the reserve to two new ceps for rotterdam and utrecht, programmes for which were presented at the end of 1996. in the case of pesca, the ecu 2 million extra allocated from the reserve will go to non-objective 1 areas. the implementation of this programme is, however, relatively slow, both within and outside the objective 1 area, in particular because of internal coordination difficulties arising from the fact that several structural funds and national authorities (the ministry, local authorities, etc.) are involved in part-financing. see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 250 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the four leader programmes have been progressing satisfactorily and the network of the four eligible regions is operational. the assessment will cover all four programmes with a specific separate analysis for each region and will be carried out by the same external agency. in flevoland the projects selected have three priorities: reducing the vulnerability of the agricultural sector, strengthening the tourism sector and increasing the viability of villages. under the employment initiative, 41 projects (15 now projects, 17 horizon projects and 9 youthstart projects) were selected in 1995 and began at the end of that year and the beginning of 1996. the now projects focus above all on women in ethnic minorities and on social welfare. the horizon projects for handicapped people support the development of a model of \"accompanied employment\", while those to assist disadvantaged young people concentrate in particular on the long-term unemployed. the youthstart projects mainly concern young people of foreign origin with few or no qualifications. the dutch authorities presented a revised draft of the programme inserting a new strand, integra, and arrangements have been made to launch an invitation for projects as part of the second series of employment projects in 1997. under the adapt programme 67 projects became operational in 1996. particular priority is given to smes and support is provided for new businesses as potential job-creators. the projects also concern the transfer of know-how and expertise from big companies to small ones, cooperation between smes and r&d and training institutions, and improving opportunities for women on the labour market. another revision of the clp was proposed to include a new strand, adapt (a), and in this case too arrangements have been made to launch an invitation for projects at the same time as the second 1997 series of adapt projects. a conference to stimulate interest in this new strand among project promoters was held in october 1997. table v-41: netherlands million) community initiatives

projects entailing an erdf contribution of some ecu 60 million (36% of assistance in 1995-99). progress was especially marked in measures providing direct aid for productive investment in industry and in those geared to improving tourism potential and business infrastructures (industrial estates, science parks, etc.). the austrian authorities approved a number of strategic projects in each of these areas during the year (e.g. major industrial investment projects like leocell in heiligenkreuz and strohal in mullendorf, the technologiezentrum in eisenstadt, and the rogner golfschaukel project in stegersbach). similar progress was recorded in rural development measures. significant results have been achieved in the creation of alternative employment in rural areas and in the field of renewable energy resources. much effort has been spent on strengthening agricultural holdings, setting up new marketing structures and creating new income opportunities in tourism (spa and sports activities). 1996 in the context of programming for 1995-99 in terms of financial implementation, starting-up problems led to delays in payments during the first half-year. despite considerable improvement in the

measures to assist productive investment. in certain cases, measures of a more innovative character are lagging behind and they should be publicized to a greater extent. at the end of the year, appropriations committed to selected projects accounted for 34% of those available for the whole programming period and 21% had been paid to the final recipients. the monitoring committees held two meetings in 1996. at the first, the membership of the committees was approved and the austrian authorities provided additional information on the practical arrangements for implementing the programmes. 1996 in the context of programming for 1995-99 as the spds were only approved in november 1995, implementation could not commence before 1996. nevertheless, the possibility of retroactive

integration of young people into working life has become necessary 64 eligibles areas: lower austria, upper austria, styria and vorarlberg. 254 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) in austria, where unemployed below the age of 25 numbered 49 000 in january 1997 (in the case of females, this represents a 2.6% rise over january 1996). measures for the vocational integration of the handicapped constitute a new approach for the authorities, which were only concerned with handicapped persons with jobs prior to the objective 3 programme. suitable structures for providing advice and guidance, improving skills and implementing aid for employment had therefore to be set up in 1996, which slowed down the implementation of the programme though time lost will be caught up in 1997. to promote equal opportunities for men and women, one example of a measure adopted in 1996 involves increasing the number of places for girls to learn skills in occupations dominated by men (4 000 to 6 000 places per month). measures to encourage the integration of long-term unemployed into the job market were initiated in 1996 and have achieved very convincing results, with 500 persons finding a job and 80% of the enterprises surveyed indicating they were aware of the programme. fig. v-54: objective 4: proerammine 1995-99 (ecu million - 1995 prices): priorities anticipating labour market

quarter are women. if the prograrnme is to succeed, enterprises' awareness and motivation must be stepped up. thanks to effective public-awareness measures by the austrian employment authorities, the number of employers concerned is actually rising. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-43: proerammine for 1995-99 (ecu million - prices and status 1996). total 392,8 measure production marketing 330,5 62.3 __ 84% 16% 1996 was the first year of full-scale application of assistance to improve production structures, forecasts for the implementation of which were approved by the commission in 1995. the assistance covers investment aid, aid for young farmers, investment aid in less-favoured areas, and aid to adapt vocational training to the requirements of modern agriculture. community funding for production structures (ecu 330.5 million) comprised ecu 60.7 million for investment aid, ecu 37 million for young farmers, ecu 1.2'million for vocational training and ecu 220.5 million for less-favoured areas. austria has requested adjustments to the system for classifying less-favoured areas established in 1995, on account of difficulties arising in certain regions. the community contribution (ecu 62.3 million) towards improving structures for the processing and marketing of products forms part of total investments amounting to ecu 913 million. at the end of 1996, approximately 44% of the total investment planned had already been committed to 189 approved projects. the most advanced sectors are meat (56 projects and 45% of total assistance committed), milk and milk products (34 projects and 26% of the total cornmitted) and fruit and vegetables (32 projects and 22% of the total committed). 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 255 objective 5(a)

implementation of the comrn units initiatives in 1996 note-austria, is not involved in konver, pesca or regis. of the new member states, austria has adopted the highest number of programmes since 1995, i.e. four implemented at national level and four interreg programmes (all with countries of central and eastern europe, namely hungary, the czech republic, slovakia and slovenia). the remaining programmes (urban, smes, rechar, r\u00e9sider, retex, eight leader and interreg programmes with germany and interreg with italy) were all adopted in 1996 with the exception of the austria-italy interreg programme. support for the development of technological potential in austria: the initiatives contributing most towards strengthening austria's technological fabric are the smes programme and certain industrial conversion initiatives. the smes programme devotes the greater pan of its funds to the introduction of advanced electronic data transmission in smes and clean, more energy-efficient production technology (ecu 3.8 million; total cost: ecu 18.8 million). it provides backing for the implementation of pilot projects (ecu 2.2 million; total cost: ecu 8.5 million - e.g. setting-up of telecentres, establishment of virtual enterprises, etc.), the development of distance training courses and support for training needed for the introduction of new environmental technology and telematics applications (ecu 1.3 million; total cost: ecu 3.2 million). in the field of industrial conversion initiatives, the rechar programme supports the introduction of new technology in the district ofvoitsberg and the municipalities of pantaleon and ampflwang, while the r\u00e9sider programme relates to economic diversification in regions affected by the declining steel industry through the development of new environmentally-friendly processes and materials, technology transfer, technology advisory services to enterprises, and support for the latters' technology infrastructure. in addition, the retex programme provides backing for the modernisation of the textile and clothing industry and the development of the tertiary sector through better know-how (e.g. encouraging the development of production technologies and new products, promoting innovation, etc.) and vocational training in new methods and technology. 13 new ceps were adopted under national programmes and one under interreg. the second urban programme for graz was adopted in october. it covers the gries area, which has 16 000 inhabitants, and will finance an integrated set of economic, social and infrastructure measures. quantitative targets were set under the programme, including the creation of some 350 new jobs. for its part, the urban 8th annual report on the structural fund1! (1996) 257 programme for vienna was adopted in december 1995. the first meeting of the monitoring committee took place on 15 may 1996. the smes programme was adopted-in april 1996, covering all areas eligible under objectives 1, 2 and 5(b). it focuses on measures to encourage the use of information technologies, environmentally friendlier production techniques and strategic planning in smes. the three industrial conversion cips were also adopted. the retex programme, adopted in may, covers various parts of areas eligible under objectives 2 and 5(b) (lower austria, styria and vorarlberg), and is mainly geared to measures to improve technical knowledge, cooperation projects and vocational training. adopted in july, the rechar cip covers the area of styria falling within objective 2 and that of upper austria falling within objective 5(b). funds are largely allocated to assistance for new technologies, promoting services and tourism, the rehabilitation of old pitheads and training measures. the programme is overseen by the monitoring committees competent for the areas concerned under objectives 2 and 5(b). lastly, the r\u00e9sider programme, also adopted in july, covers regions in styria, lower austria and upper austria, with the appropriations being allocated principally to innovation in the steel industry for materials or production techniques, the introduction of new technologies and quality control in smes, and training. like the rechar clp, this programme is overseen by the monitoring committees competent for the various areas concerned under objective 2. lastly, eight leader cips were adopted in 1996, comprising seven regional programmes and one technical assistance programme relating to the national network of local groups. the regional cips entail ecu 20.6 million in community financing out of a total estimated cost of ecu 65.4 million. 26 lags were set up and, in line with the strengths and weaknesses of their regions, opted for fairly widely diverging objectives. some lags, albeit a minority, chose areas of technological development or research. in burgenland (objective 1 ), the projects selected by the leader groups seek to achieve sustainable development. owing to administrative problems, the programme took time to get off the ground but implementation is now going well. the human resources programmes were adopted in 1995. under employment, 54 projects were selected in 1996 pursuant to the last call for proposals (16 now, 17 horizon, 9 integra and 12 youthstart projects), the programme being incorporated into the new integra section. the now projects concentrate on employment and the training of women in frontier technology sectors and on their access to management posts and the establishment of enterprises. the horizon projects focus on quality training for the handicapped and their integration by providing assistance rather than shelter, and they involve action by advisers, trainers, social workers, human resources managers and the social partners. the integra projects combine information on the employment market, advisory services. work experience and measures tailored to the individual to assist the socially marginalised, the target groups being the long-term unemployed, single mothers and persons threatened with social exclusion. the youthstart projects give priority to young people in economically less-favoured regions, those under threat of marginalisation, young people who are experiencing learning difficulties or who have dropped out of the school system and young people of immigrant origin. in the case of adapt, 30 projects were selected, focusing on aid for innovation and modernisation of smes. local networking is in place to cover smes and support structures with the participation of private and public training bodies. the projects also include innovation in the field of training in environmental protection work, quality assurance systems for industry' and the service sector and teach-yourself material. 258 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) adopted in december 1995, the four interreg programmes for the external frontiers with slovenia, slovakia, the czech republic and hungary took off extremely slowly, in particular because of the difficulty of finalising cross-border cooperation measures with the countries concerned. nevertheless, great strides were made in 1996 and implementation is now progressing satisfactorily in most cases. the next monitoring committee meetings will take place at the same time as those of the joint programming and inspection committee for each adjacent country in june 1997. lastly, the distribution of the reserve for the community initiatives enabled an additional ecu 18 million to be allocated to austria and apportioned among the interreg, urban, leader, emploi and adapt initiatives, interreg's share amounting to one third66. table v-45: austria - community initiatives - 1996 in the context

obiective in 1996 support for the development of technological potential in portugal : the importance of technological development is recognised in both the main priorities of the csf, improving the competitiveness of the economy and increasing skill levels. within the 'competitiveness' priority, a sub-priority is devoted to telecommunications. it continues the progress on advanced services made during the first programming period (supply of isdn and introduction of fibre optic links into the local network). the development of telecommunications as regards both quantity (infrastructure) and quality (reduction of the time to install lines and number of faults per line), and the promotion of advanced telecommunications services and stimulation of supply to meet market needs is being implemented by the infrastructure op, the telecommunications strand of which has ecu 276 million (total cost: ecu 550.2 million). a larger budget is allocated to rtd in the priorities for the modernisation of the main sectors of the portuguese economy. under the the 'modernisation of the economic fabric' op, the 'industry' sub-programme, which has to deal with an industrial structure highly specialised in labour-intensive activities involving a low level of technology, stresses the development of scientific and technological infrastructure and encourages their use by firms through involvement in the research activities related to the design and improvement of new products and processes. this programme also includes grants to firms for the purchase and development of new technologies. commerce and services are covered by a separate sub-programme which supports the modernisation of equipment in firms in the field of customer services and the management of payments (diversification of selling methods by using computer techniques and telecommunications). as in the 1989-93 csf, the 'agriculture' sub-programme contributes to the expansion of agricultural research and the training of farmers and technicians. similarly, the 'fisheries' sub-programme supports research into the fishing industry and better use of the resources available to the processing industry. in addition to these multiregional sub-programmes, support for the modernisation of agriculture and fisheries is provided by some of the regional programmes. the op for madeira lays particular emphasis on the importance of research in these fields. in general terms, this assistance also helps diversify economic activity in the various regions. each of the regional ops enjoys a differentiated budget for science and technology, and for telecommunications. the measures to assist firms and rtd infrastructure are complemented by education and skills for those working in science and technology as provided for in the csf priority for human resources. this is implemented through the 'bases for knowledge and innovation' op, which seeks to consolidate the results of the earlier ciencia programme. the 'education' sub-programme pays particular attention to the teaching of science and technology, at both non-compulsory secondary level and in higher education, and to the training of teachers. these measures should benefit 600 000 people. the 'science and technology ' sub-programme, which has ecu 376 million (total cost: ecu 525 millions), provides support for the 'industry' sub-programme with regard to university research and the integration of research workers into industry by-financing projects for cooperation between universities and firms and training laboratory assistants and research centre managers. the development of data transmission applications is covered not only by some of the measures considered but also in the strategy for the modernisation of the postal sector and the prinest op, which supports the provision of infrastructure for computer applications to develop a system of statistical information able to assist in the modernisation and economic development of portugal and which will build on the results of the earlier preder programme. in total, finance for technological development in portugal accounts for 9,5% of the appropriations from the structural funds. table v-46: portugal - financing directly related to technological development in programming for 1994-99 (ecu million) financing by the structural funds

interim evaluation of all the programmes and sub-programmes in the csf. this took place in a spirit of partnership between the commission and the portuguese authorities. teams of independent experts were selected by means of a call for tenders for each item of assistance under the csf. the monitoring committee for each sub-programme set up a technical working party on evaluation to which each assessor was required to present two progress reports prior to the definitive final report expected early in 1997. the whole process ran completely smoothly. only the technical assistance op is being evaluated as part of the evaluation of the whole of the csf planned for 1997, but its design had already been decided on in 1996. these evaluation studies, for most of which the final report is already available, should ensure that the mid-term review of the csf planned for mid-1997 is of a good quality. some programmes were amended and/or reprogrammed. among the multiregional programmes, the technical assistance op was amended as regards the financial implementation of the esf strand by transferring to 1996 appropriations which had not been used in 1994 and which could not be absorbed in 1995. following decisions taken by the monitoring committee in 1995, the 'modernisation of the economic fabric' op received a further community contribution of ecu 101 million. of this amount, ecu 61 million from the erdf and ecu 11 million from the esf were allocated to the autoeuropa major project. the 'infrastructure to support development' op was reprogrammed to bring financial implementation in 1994 in line with actual implementation by the energy, transport and telecommunications sub-programmes, to provide an extra ecu 10.9 million for the transport sub-programme and to cope with the varying rates of implementation of the transport and energy sub-programmes. these changes balanced each other out and did not result in an amendment to the annual financing schedule for the programme. the 'environment and urban renewal' op was also reprogrammed both to include private social solidarity institutions (tpss) among the beneficiaries of the urban renewal sub-programme and to make a transfer between measures in the environment sub-programme. this reprogramming also made it possible to increase the appropriations available for the setting up of small-scale economic activities in shantytowns (up to 15% of the total amount for the measure 'renovation of shantytowns\"). the 'vocational training' and 'bases of knowledge' ops were also reprogrammed, as was the 'health and social integration' op. following decisions taken by the csf monitoring cornmittee in december 1995, the 'bases of knowledge' and 'innovation' ops received an extra ecu 14.4 million from the esf as a result of the 1995 indexation to provide finance for technical and vocational education. implementation of the 'vocational training and employment' op, which accounts for 40% of assistance from the esf under the csf, continued to be very satisfactory, at almost 100%. the 'training of the civil service' sub-programme continued to experience some problems. in april, the programme received an extra ecu 10.2 million from the 'agriculture' sub-programme to pay for agricultural training schemes devised by the portuguese farmers' federation. the measures 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 261 'apprenticeships' and 'training of instructors' also received transfers of amounts not used by other measures. the csf monitoring committee also decided to allocate to this programme ecu 18 million from the 1995 indexation of the csf for a pilot measure to train managers and workers in small firms. the 'health and social integration' op was reprogrammed on two occasions. in may 1996, the amounts not used in 1994 were transferred to 1995 and 1996 and the measure 'economic and social integration of the handicapped' received a further ecu 8.5 million not used by the measures 'support for sociocultural development\" and 'economic and social integration of the cld\" under the 'social integration' sub-programme. in december 1996, the 1995 instalment was adjusted to reflect implementation and the amounts not used were transferred to future years. this amendment concerned mainly the 'health' sub-programme, since implementation of the 'social integration' sub-programme was 99%. two regional programmes were also amended. the community contribution to the norte op was increased by ecu 4.1 million in 1996. the azores op was amended to increase the erdf's financial contribution by ecu 5 million and apply to measures financed by the eaggf the ecu 5.1 million from the fifg which had not yet been used. this decision was taken on condition that the fifg's contribution was increased correspondingly when the measures financed by that financial instrument reached the degree of implementation originally estimated. while programming generally made satisfactory progress, there were some delays and difficulties. the delay in implementing the technical assistance op was due both to the late adoption of the programme and to changes in the structure for managing the esf in portugal. a great deal of this delay should be made up in 1997. the special features of the multifund programme 'locally-generated development' (ppdr-erdf, eaggf, esf) continued to cause some problems in implementation, mainly because the ppdr is a programme which requires a high degree of participation in decision-making by regional and local bodies through partnerships between the public and private sectors. from the second half of 1996, however, its implementation generally improved thanks to the pace achieved by certain measures, particularly the rime and slr aid schemes. in the case of the 'bases of knowledge and innovation' op, there are still some problems in the 'science and technology' sub-programme, which provides for the financing of research projects submitted by teams of research workers to be selected by means of a procedure based on a public invitation. preparation of the rules for these invitations took longer than planned and it was not until 1996 that financing foi* this type of measure could begin. this meant that implementation of the sub-programme remained relatively poor. _ in the case of the 'modernisation of the economic fabric' op and the 'industry' sub-programme (pedip ii), it should be noted that, following improvements made to national procedures in portugal, the time required to consider applications for investment aid has been considerably reduced. the main aid schemes are virtually exhausted. within the 'modernisation of the economic fabric' op, the 'agriculture' sub-programme was implemented at a rate of 91% in 1996. among the eight measures in this sub-programme, some significant variations should be noted: support for agricultural holdings reached a rate of 124%, agricultural infrastructure 84% and the processing and marketing of products, 61%, which may be explained by the longer time required to complete these projects. the 'support for commerce and services' sub-programme regained a certain vigour after a period of slow implementation. under the 'fisheries' sub-programme, which concerns continental portugal, 223 projects were approved in 1996, involving total public expenditure of ecu 32.4 million, 60% of the total programmed (the private sector contributed ecu 11.8 million). public expenditure approved since the beginning of the sub-programme amounts to ecu 129.5 million and the implementation rate at the end of this period is 20% of the total programmed for 1994-99. such a level of implementation required reprogramming to redistribute the balance not used in 1994 to 1997, 1998 and 1999. this reprograrnrning will make available the funds required to establish a new socio-economic measure arising from the changes introduced by regulation (ec) no 1796/95 amending regulation (ec) no 3699/93. turning to the two regional ops containing measures for fisheries, 52 projects in the azores were approved between 1994 and 1996 involving investment totalling some ecu 18 million, to which the 262 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) community will contribute ecu 11.2 million and national public finances ecu 4.2 million (the private sector is contributing ecu 4 million). financial implementation for that period is 17% of the total programmed. the trend is improving and the level is expected to be satisfactory by the end of 1997. in madeira, 1996 was mainly a year for retrieving the delays which had accumulated in 1994 and 1995. the number of projects approved since the beginning of the programme (51 projects) involved a total investment of ecu 15.5 million with public expenditure approved for that period amounting to ecu 10.3 million, of which the fifg will pay ecu 7.7 million. the rate of implementation for the first three years amounts to 19% of the total programmed for 1994-99, but the positive trend noted in 1996 suggests that this may improve substantially in 1997. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 in general, implementation of the csf is proceeding satisfactorily, although at a slightly slower pace than in 1995. the overall rate of implementation in 1996 was about 82%. the regional programmes are progressing well in financial and physical terms and their impact on the development of the regions is considerable (particularly in terms of basic infrastructure related to living conditions). most of the sectoral programmes are also progressing without problems and some sectors, such as 'telecommunications' and 'transports', have exceeded the rate of implementation planned for 1996. implementation of the four multifund programmes to which the eaggf is contributing was generally in line with estimates. more specifically, the rate of implementation of the 'agriculture' sub-programme of the 'modernisation of the economic fabric' op is in excess of programming (the 1997 annual instalment was committed in 1996). the rate of implementation of the azores op (pedra) required its eaggf component to be increased by ecu 5 million. table v-47: portugal - assistance by objective - 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99

community initiatives in 1996 note: portugal takes part in all the initiatives and all the programmes were adopted between 1993 and 1995. eleven cips are being implemented at national level (one per initiative), plus two interreg cips, one under the regen strand and the other under the cross-border cooperation strand. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 263 support for the development of technological potential in portugal : although most of the community initiatives in portugal promote technological development, the largest contribution comes from two measures under the smes initiative: grants for projects to encourage technological skills in small firms through technical support or the transfer of technology from scientific and technological bodies to small firms (ecu 13 million; total cost: ecu 24 million), and training in advanced technologies for the managers of firms (ecu 11.8 million; total cost: ecu 21.6 million). the adapt programme also includes a number of measures relating to the introduction of new technologies and support for the establishment of information networks and the employment cip supports uses of data transmission (new technologies, distance working, etc.) by less favoured groups in society and the purchase of equipment (ecu 4 millions; total cost: ecu 5 million). the leader programme supports research and innovation in the processing of local products and the use of new technologies for information and communications in rural areas. interreg is concerned with the installation of fibre optics and sdh connections between spain and portugal and the establishment of information networks in the tourism sector as a contribution to the development of the information society. a significant feature of 1996 was the commission decision on the allocation of the reserve for the community initiatives. portugal will receive an additional ecu 52.4 million, mainly for the extension until 1999 of the four industrial initiatives (retex, konver, r\u00e9sider and rechar67) and the new strand interreg ii c. as far as the programmes already being implemented are concerned, retex was amended to include the results of the indexation for 1994, 1995 and 1996 (a total of ecu 5.8 million). community assistance for repayable loans was reduced, mainly to benefit measures to support internationalisation and greater productivity. during 1996, the proportion of finance from this programme to firms in the textiles sector fell: more than 757c of finance under the retex cep is now being used for economic diversification measures in regions of portugal heavily dependent on textiles. there have been some delays in implementing programmes. implementation of the smes ce? was delayed because of changes in national legislation but this programme should operate normally in 1997. the delay in the financial and physical implementation of the urban programme arose from difficulties in introducing an organisational system among the various partners and to some problems which proved more difficult to resolve than had originally been expected (mainly in the casal ventoso area of lisbon, which has very poor housing and a severe drugs problem). there is a good chance of improvements in 1997 because the programme managers now have action plans, studies on securing the first urban indicators and methods of organising the local partnership. it should be noted that in december 1996, at the initiative of the portuguese authorities, a seminar to exchange experiences was arranged for the managers of the six sub-programmes comprising the urban cip. this proved to be very useful. in the case of the leader programme, the late selection of the local action groups led to some problems because of the excessively long gap between the first and second phases of prograrnming. however, the programme got underway: all the lags have now been selected and implementation of the financing, plans has begun. there was some delay too in implementing the cross-border cooperation strand of the interreg ii programme. the regen programme, however, was implemented as planned and by the end of 1996, the national gas pipeline and its first link with the spanish gas network had been completed. this strand was the subject of technical reprogramming during 1996. under the employment initiative, some 130 projects were selected during the first call for proposals (40 under now, 57 under horizon and 33 under youthstart). in all three strands, the stress was on training. the main theme of the now projects was the development of employment programmes and encouraging women to set up businesses. a large number of projects under youthstart concern vocational guidance and training for young people. under horizon, the stress was on creating conditions which encourage the employment of people with handicaps. 57 projects were selected under the adapt initiative, many of them to do with training. most projects are designed to improve management systems and the restructuring of small firms in various sectors of the economy. 67 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 264 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the first applications and selection of projects under pesca began at the end of 1995 and the work of the monitoring committee concerned amendments to the programme and its launch. information campaigns were held in the azores and madeira during 1996. since the bulk of the cips had been approved by the commission in 1995, 1996 was the first year of actual implementation, following the period required for introduction of the national legislation required, establishment of the teams to manage the programmes, etc. the levels of financial implementation for most of the initiatives may be considered satisfactory in terms of the community assistance planned in the programmes. table v-48: portugal - community initiatives 1994-99 (ecu million) 1996 in

development of technological potential in the regions of finland: most of the development measures under the various objectives reflect the national strategy to foster the information society. the strategy aims to establish finland as an advanced information society and global competitor in information and communications technologies by modernising the public and private sectors through the introduction of information technology and networks (e.g. use of the internet), development of the information industry (e.g. multimedia), university courses in new technology (e.g. doctorates in information technology), popularisation of the information society (e.g. educational materials, virtual schools) and improvements to infrastructure (e.g. telecommunications liberalisation, expansion of digitisation, legislative reform). objective 6: one its main goals is to prepare the population for participation in the information society and to use all the technologies it offers for economic growth, competitiveness and employment. two priorities in the spd are involved: \u0142 enterprise development: cooperation between research and educational centres and businesses, development of services linked to rtd and advanced technology; development of telecommunications services to facilitate innovation transfer to areas located far from advanced centres (ecu 9.4 million; total cost: ecu 33.1 million); development of data transmission services and applications in research, education and social services, the creation of telecentres in rural areas, etc. \u0142 development of human resources: investment in advanced educational establishments and in the rtd activities needed to improve training (ecu 16.7 million; total cost: ecu 35.3 million); aid for research and training in key economic sectors (e.g. funding researchers in enterprises, development of university rtd, etc.; ecu 9.5 million, total cost: ecu 19.3 million); improved cooperation between the research centres, local developpient companies, educational establishments and enterprises so that inn\u00e7vation might be better directed and managed (e.g. technology transfers, development of technological management, etc; ecu 11 million, total cost: ecu 23.6 million), development of the information society, especially in telecommunications and tele-working so that the working place and time can be planned in alternative ways (distance education, training of businessmen in new technology, research in such fields, training for managers of research and education centres, etc. ecu 3.7 million; total cost: ecu 9.4 million). the objective 6 regions do not all accord the same importance to these priorities: the regions of south and north savo devote substantial funds to agri-food, forestry and environmental rtd; central finland and north ostrobothnia emphasise the training system, data networks and distance learning; north karelia is concentrating on forestry, metals and plastics research; lapland is focusing on training in telecommunications methods, geographical information, environmental and spatial research and information technology. objective 2 (1995-96): the spd bases modernisation of the productive sector on using the opportunities offered by the information society. this explains the importance placed on technological development by two of the spd's three priorities : \u0142 development and globalisation of enterprises: enterprise networking, the development of new products and production processes, transfer of technology to smes and the development of industrial niche markets. one characteristic of the spd is that clean technology figures among the project selection criteria. these operations have a considerable impact on the development of environmental technology in kymenlaakso, rtd in p\u00e2ij\u00e0t-h\u00e0me and information technology in central finland. \u0142 improvements to training levels and technological support for economic activities (ecu 16.3 million; total cost ecu 45.6 million): cooperation between enterprises and research and training centres (e.g. creation of a know-how centre in uusimaa), introduction of innovation in enterprises (e.g. teleworking), development of data networks for technology transfer, development of environmental technology, technological cooperation with enterprises in neighbouring countries; use of existing university research infrastructure (e.g universities of jyv\u00e0skyl\u00e0 and fori, jyvdskyld institute of technology, etc.) objective 5(b): the two spds support technological development as a tool for the spds' priorities. to shorten the distances between rural communities, the mainland finland spd concentrates on developing data communications services through experimental projects to create networks, telecentres and teleworking centres, build special communications links and provide connections by modem and software. in the aland islands information technology is used to reduce the region's isolation by developing sme networks and 266 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) communications infrastructures, for example, by creating technology and know-how centres, encouraging teleworking, distance learning and training, and by publicising the region's cultural heritage. in au\\ the funds allocated to technological development in finland represent 12.9% of the

end of the year, about 30% of the assistance was allocated to various projects. among the main project categories benefiting from funding are the launch of smes and investment in business expansion, cooperation between associated enterprises under certain terms (especially as regards technology transfers within business niches), training, information society projects, tourism development and small-scale forestry and agricultural diversification projects. investments in agriculture and rural development have suffered some delays, however, because of the need to check the conformity of the national aid schemes with articles 92 and 93 of the treaty and because of the strict national policy adopted in the case of the investment aid schemes. with 70 projects launched, fishery measures are progressing satisfactorily, except for aquaculture where progress has been modest. in the first five months of the year, specific issues relating to implementation and procedure were addressed by the working group responsible for organising objective 6. the national and regional authorities and the commission were represented on the working group. the group's report served as a guide for the various partners implementing the programme and helped to improve mutual cooperation, particularly between the central government and regional authorities. however, it was hard to ensure proper monitoring of the funding and payment decisions because of the large number 68 eligible areas: lapland, kainuu, north karelia, south savo, north ostrobothnia, south ostrobothnia, north savo, central finland. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 267 of participants and shortcomings in the content and use of the data bases relating to the projects. efforts to improve the monitoring system are continuing. the monitoring committee held two meetings, the most notable points of which were the appointment of an external evaluator and a decision to invest in a regional venture capital fund - the first investment of its kind in a finnish programme. the november meeting also prepared the way for the mid-term assessment, to be carried out in autumn of 1997. 1996 in the context of programming for 1995-99 while commitments for projects progressed relatively quickly, the same can not be said for payments. by the end of the year, the commission had paid out only 18% of the structural fund assistance. the problems arising from the slowness in payment are being closely examined as part of the work being done on monitoring and ongoing assessment. objective 269 fie. v-59:

14.4 million), plus the amount resulting from indexation for 1996, was transferred to the new 1997-99 programme. as in the case of the objective 6 programme, payments to the beneficiaries progressed at a slower pace than commitments. at the end of the year the national authorities had paid out to projects only 16% of the. assistance for 1995-96, while the proportion committed was- 78%. furthermore, the partnership between the central and regional authorities developed along the lines of the objective 6 programme and the same difficulties with monitoring arose as a result. it became apparent that the checks on the results of the programme were not trustworthy, especially in terms of job creation: the aim of creating 10 000 new jobs in the first period does not appear to have been achieved. preparation of the 1997-99 programming period the proposal for the new programme was submitted in august and approved in principle by the commission in december. the new programme was made more detailed but simpler in structure by reducing the number of measures from 15 to 9; an early evaluation of the results of the first period was also undertaken and ways of implementing the new financial arrangements and of using the funds more effectively were explored with the finnish authorities. thus, in the case of infrastructure and port infrastructure in particular, it was agreed to use eib loans, experiment with financial packages combining grants and loans and encourage inter-regional projects. the evaluators' report also indicated the need to be more pro-active in the preparation of projects, especially in very small firms. the aim of the second period is to create or reskill 15 800 jobs. 69 eligible areas: satakunta, kokkola, ita-uusimaa and kymenlaakso,

in 1996 the main feature of 1996 was the implementation on the ground of programmes already under way. although 1996 was the third year of the 1994-99 programming period, it was, for most objectives, member states and regions, and for most measures, only the second full year of activity. the commission adopted only 50 new measures (35 ops, 8 spds, 3 major projects, 4 global grants), which concern objective 1 of the greek, spanish, irish and italian csfs, objective 3 (united kingdom only), objective 5(a) with the adoption of all the ops under the italian csf, and the final stages in launching programming in sweden with the adoption of the swedish spds under objectives 4, 5(a) and 5(b). the new assistance totals ecu 3 448 million (comprising 55% from the esf, 32% from the erdf and 13% from the eaggf), and represents less than 3% of total assistance adopted for 1994-99 as a whole. structural fund programming now involves 492 forms of assistance (i.e. ops, spds, global grants and major projects), by far the largest proportion in the form of spds and ops, which account for 48% each of the total number of measures (global grants account for 2% and major projects for 1%). on average, taking all objectives together, there are 33 measures per member state; however, the range is wide, from 8 in denmark and luxembourg to 97 in italy. table 1-1: csf/spd - assistance and number of

programming was implemented. this is illustrated by financial implementation: commitments made in 1996 represent 37% of total commitments since 1994, taking all the objectives together; and, even more significantly, payments in 1996 alone represent 44% of total payments since 1994, which is a sign that the measures have now taken off. implementation also involved more and closer monitoring of programmes under the monitoring committees, where the corrimission encouraged the sound financial management of assistance, the selection of projects in line with by the community's priorities

40% of the esf budget had already been committed to projects. most projects had been submitted by training bodies and public authorities and implementation of the programme was boosted by local agents responsible for researching and preparing projects on behalf of company directors who often lacked the time and resources to implement the training ideas or plan the project. objective 5(a)

for mainland finland, in particular by strengthening the regional monitoring committees. one of the other main tasks was to launch the ongoing evaluation process by selecting an evaluator for each

the community initiatives in 1996 finland is not participating in 5 community initiatives: rechar, r\u00e9sider, retex, konver and regis. two community initiative programmes were approved in 1995 (adapt and employment); the remaining programmes (smes, urban, 2 leader, pesca, 7 interreg) were approved in 1996. support for the development of technological potential in finland: information and communications technologies play an important role in most of the priorities in the leader and smes programmes (creation of networks, internationalisation and cooperation, data bases, new activities under development - electronics, software, etc., electronic commerce, etc.) and in the adapt programme (promotion of teleworking, distance learning, introduction of new technologies in enterprises and the creation of databases). the interreg programmes also place particular importance on the new information technologies: \u0142 between finland and sweden: introduction of telecommunications technology and improvements to logistical systems to reduce the geographic isolation of the border area, improve the technological capabilities of enterprises and women and protect the region's environment; \u0142 between sweden, finland and norway: in the kvarken-mittskandia region, coordination of the emergency services and new telecommunications technology (e.g., teleconferencing, cross-border networks, etc.) and training development through distance learning and technology transfers, etc.; in the northern arctic region, as part of the efforts to improve the living conditions of the sami people, human resources will be strengthened through information technology (e.g. multimedia training, development of technological capacities in support of business, teleworking, distance learning); \u0142 between finland, sweden, norway and russia: cooperation and dissemination of information between enterprises through networks, the organisation of networks between research centres and trade and industry, development of training in multimedia and distance language learning, improvements to the area's internal operating capacity by interconnecting telecommunications, the use of information technology for mapping purposes, shared data bases and emergency services, etc.; \u0142 between finland and russia: rtd networks to exchange experts, improvements to information services and the development of telecommunications for environmental purposes in karelia; telecommunications improvements in the \"nordic triangle\", the application of new technologies to environmental protection and land planning, increased know-how through networking, distance learning, open universities and the development of information research and technology ineast finland. 8th annual report on the structural fund1; (1996) 271 the urban community initiative programme for joensuu also makes full use of data transmission and information technology to prevent social exclusion and assist the long-term unemployed back into the jobs market. it is aiding the introduction and extension of the chain of palveluelli data transmission services, information and support for the creation of smes through information technology and local residents' access to the information networks. lastly, the pesca programme seeks to create three data networks linking producers, fish processors, the markets and the advisory organisations with a view to improving the^vay the fish market operates. _^ five national and seven interreg programmes were adopted in 1996. firstly, the urban community initiative programme approved in july for the city of joensuu aims to make its target group - families in difficulty and the unemployed living in a vast area of housing estates - more conscious of the responsibilities involved in living in society and self-reliant; it also aims to provide training and advice and involve the unemployed in improving their environment so that a return to more social behaviour is instilled in the area in question. the programme is operated directly by the municipality. secondly, the smes programme, approved in november, concentrates mainly on technology transfer and development, the globalisation of smes and inter-enterprise cooperation and networks. one of the leader programmes involves the objective 6 areas and the other the objective 5(b) areas. they were adopted in august and july respectively. the first has already chosen 10 local action groups and the second 12 local action groups, all of which have begun implementing the measures. leader has been generally well received as the rural development model it fosters is highly relevant to the efforts made in finland in this regard. lastly, the pesca programme adopted in march has not yet started but the finnish authorities have introduced the legislative framework (application forms, evaluation forms, national rules and regulations) that will allow it to begin early in 1997. the seven interreg programmes in which finland is participating were also approved in july. two of the programmes involve cooperation with sweden (aland island and kvarken-mittskandia), one cooperation with sweden and norway north of the arctic circle, three cooperation with russia (the barents programme, involving also sweden and norway, the karelia programme and the south-east finland programme) and one on cooperation between finland and estonia across the gulf of finland. total investment in the programmes amounts to ecu 199 million, of which ecu 63 million (the combined swedish and finnish shares) comes from the structural funds. the figures show that there has been a significant expansion in funding possibilities for cross-border activities. on the russian and estonian side efforts are being made to fund activities that improve compatibility between the interreg projects and the tacis and phare programmes. the programmes' originality lies in the pooling of funding and unified financial management along the finno-swedish border (a single region being responsible for managing the funds for the whole programme) and in the advanced decentralisation of decision-making. the first meetings of the programme monitoring cornmittees were held in october. the employment and adapt programmes, which had been adopted in 1995, selected projects at the start of the year which were subsequently launched during the year. in the first six months, 3 000 individuals participated in a total of 31 employment projects (11 now projects, 9 youthstart, 11 horizon - equivalent to 100 000 training days)) and involved 87 partners in other countries (in particular ireland, the united kingdom and germany). the projects are directed towards the long-term unemployed, drug addicts, immigrants, former prisoners and the handicapped, and the promotion of equal opportunities in the labour market. support for social enterprises and assisted employment were the predominant themes. under the adapt programme (28 projects) aid was provided to assist workers adapt to industrial change through virtual work experience and teleworking projects. one hundred and fourteen (114) partners from other countries participated in the projects (mainly from the united kingdom, italy and germany). project promoters for the two initiatives were mainly ngos or public authorities, educational bodies in particular. lastly, the decision to allocate the reserve for the community initiatives enabled an extra ecu 18.9 million to be released to finland for all the initiatives, with the exception of smes initiative.71. 71 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 272 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) tableau v-52: finland million) community initiatives - 1996 in the context of

bv obiective in 1996 support for the development of technological potential in the regions of sweden : objective 6: each spd priority contains support measures for the information society (16.2% of community appropriations). this falls within the broader objective of spreading know-how, and includes the development of communication systems and associated technologies, encouraging the use of new technologies in businesses and developing regional databases. it also involves developing advanced telecommunications technologies to fill in the gaps in rtd for small businesses and applying these new technologies to education (basic and higher education through distance learning, new techniques for improving the quality of education, communication among swedish schools and with schools in other countries to exchange experience). as part of the development of human resources, new teaching techniques are being used to strengthen cultural identity at local and regional level (e.g.: documentary databases, cultural and historical databases, etc.), to improve local public services and to improve health care and the quality of life in areas remote from the regional centres (e.g. remote medical prescriptions). under the priority for supporting the sami people, it is planned to create a database and multimedia facilities in sami to promote their culture and to combine traditional reindeer rearing techniques with the use of new technology. support for technological development is also essential in measures to support employment, trade and industry. finally, the use of technology is being encouraged to develop agricultural, forestry and fisheries productivity and markets while preserving natural resources. objective 2: rtd plays a key role in the strategy of all the spds (6.1% of community funds), both in determining priorities and in selecting and implementing projects: \u0142 blekinge : it is planned to introduce information technologies (ecu 2.5 million; total cost: ecu 11 million) as a way of creating jobs and giving all citizens access to the information society. this involves promoting research and information technologies in all private and publiceconomics activities (businesses, rural development, public health care, infrastructures, rtd, etc.), and infrastructure and industrial development (creation of innovation centres); \u0142 norra norrlandskusten : one priority (ecu 2.9 million; total cost: ecu 12 million) is to stimulate the use of information technologies, in particular in businesses, and another (ecu 9 million; total cost: ecu 40.5 million) is to encourage collaboration between businesses and research centres (spreading information on technology, technology transfer projects); \u0142 \u00e0ngermanlandkusten : this spd does not have a priority for information technologies as such, but it has one for innovation in businesses (ecu 3.3 million; total cost : ecu 23.2 million). furthermore, one of the project selection criteria is the application of new technologies.; \u0142 bergslagen : here encouragement of the use of new technologies is focused on businesses, in particular in the least populated areas and the areas furthest from urban centres, through cooperation between businesses and research centres (ecu 5 million; total cost: ecu 18.8 million) and training in r&d (ecu 3 million; total cost: ecu 11.3 million); \u0142 fyrstad : technological development is integrated in local development measures, measures to develop human resources and to improve training, but also in measures to improve the capacities of businesses (ecu 3.3 million; total cost: ecu 17.9 million), particularly as regards environmental technologies. it is also one of the project selection criteria. objective 5(b) : all the programmes have a technology component, with telecommunications, rtd and telematics treated as instruments for overcoming the isolation of rural areas: \u0142 sk\u00e2ergarden : use of new telecommunication technologies and telematics to link the islands with the rest of the country; development of distance learning; \u0142 v\u00e2stra sverige and vasterbotten/g\u00e0vle/dala : telecommunications development; \u0142 sydbstra sverige : support for rtd programmes; \u0142 gotland: support for telematics applications. in total, the financing of technological development in

the measures, and a regional group has been set up with responsibility for measures relating to r&d measures, information technologies and tourism where these require a strategic approach. the pace of implementation of the spd was disappointing in 1996. a working party for implementation had been set up by the monitoring committee to draw up guidelines for regional and local authorities responsible for project selection in each of the seven districts covered by objective 6. these guidelines were not in the end published until the middle of 1996, with the result that implementation was delayed. however, the situation improved in the second half of the year, so that by the end of the year the projects approved accounted for about 80% of the financing package provided for 1995-96. most progress was made under measures relating to local development, r&d and information technologies, while measures to support businesses lagged behind. since small businesses expressed concern about access to the spd, a special group was set up to study the problem and report to the spd's monitoring committee. under the rtd measure the monitoring committee approved an allocation of ecu 9 million to the kiruna research institute for the environment and regional planning; this is the largest-scale project approved to date. eligible areas: j\u00e0mtland. varmland, kopparberg. g\u00e0vleborg,

job creation (about 21 000 new jobs). during the first half of 1996, the national and regional authorities made a considerable effort to establish adequate structures and procedures for the administration, monitoring and assessment of the programmes. the programmes' implementation fell somewhat behind. in the second half of the year the situation improved markedly. at the end of the year the projects approved at regional level accounted for 20% of the structural fund assistance available for the programming period. moreover, in most of the regions many projects were nearing completion, which gives grounds to expect that most of the initial delays will be made up during 1997. \"\"\" the objective 2 monitoring committees met three times in 1996. at their meetings they finalized implementation arrangements and the interim assessment process was initiated. they also analysed difficulties encountered in the implementation of spds (project approval procedures, delays in payments to final beneficiaries, participation by small businesses). 1996 in the context of the 1995-99 programming period despite the rapid improvement in project approval rates during the second half of the year, the level of payments to final beneficiaries remained very low (at the end of the year they accounted for hardly more than 5% of the appropriations available for the whole programming period). this was principally because of delays in approval during the first half of the year, but also to a certain extent because of the comparative cumbersome nature of the

in the public health care sector (networks of self-employed individuals may also submit projects). the general strategy is to orient production to customer demand by reorganizing working time and methods and developing employees' skills. the first, compulsory, stage of the projects is an analysis of the situation of each business prior to drafting an action plan. no project is launched unless it has been approved by and involves the participation of the business's employees. a new national agency is responsible for the daily administration of the programme while the national employment office is responsible for its financial implementation. objective 4 has been greeted with a great deal of interest in sweden. 3 066 projects were selected in 1996. these involve 250 businesses with more than 50 employees, 2 856 businesses with fewer than 50 employees and 1 467 with fewer than 10 employees. the total number of participants is 63 620, of whom 37% are women. however there is a risk that the slowness of financial implementation may dampen this enthusiasm. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-54: implementation forecasts 1995-99 (ecu million.'situation 1996) ________ 92,2 measures

respect. measures to support young farmers were 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 277 applied from 1996, in which year 149 beneficiaries were registered. this figure, which is lower than expected, may be explained by the fact that the aid mechanism is new to farmers in sweden, who have still to become familiar with it. finally, the support arrangements for investment in agricultural holdings, which were approved at the end of 1996, are to be implemented in 1997. the emphasis will be on protecting the environment, animal welfare and diversification of activities. the spd for assistance with product processing and marketing was adopted in march 1996. eligible costs total ecu 188 million. the meat and milk and milk product sectors will receive about 61% of the funds available. the five other sectors (poultry, fruit and vegetables, flowers and plants, potatoes and forestry products) will receive ecu 9 million. implementation of the arrangements began at the end of

multiannual programming with long-term strategies and the monitoring of objectives were innovations; the regional programmes, which include areas straddling traditional county boundaries, entailed active cooperation among the new partners, including the social partners. this also involved creating new authorities (the regional monitoring cornmittees) and adapting administrative and inspection systems to community requirements. 74 eligible areas: syd\u00f4stra sverige, v\u00e2sterbotten/g\u00e2vla/dala, v\u00e2stra sverige, sk\u00e0vg\u00e2rden, gotland (island of). 28 8th annual report on

1994-99 confirms this gathering momentum. taking all the objectives together, the share of financing committed represents almost half the total, and the share paid represents one third of that for the whole period. however, the situation varies from one objective to another. objective 2 is a special case: the rate of implementation during the first phase, 1994-96, should be assessed in the light of the delay in launching the programmes, which led to a reduction in the amount originally allocated to the first phase, with transfer of financing to the second phase, 1997-99. of the financing originally 2 see below section 3 for objective 2. and section 4 for objectives 3 and 4. 278 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) financial implementation in 1996 reflected the fact that the programmes were being launched, and on-the-ground implementation did not begin until autumn. however, they started up relatively slowly because of the novelty of the system and, to some extent, the uncertainty of potential beneficiaries about the timing and method of implementation. the state of implementation was discussed at the two monitoring committee meetings held in each region in november, and the importance of informing potential beneficiaries was stressed. the pace of implementation was stepped up somewhat at the end of the year and it may be hoped that this progress will continue in 1997. monitoring the progress of implementation will be one of the main tasks of the assessors, who were selected at the end of the year and will submit their interim assessment reports in june 1997. table v-55: sweden - assistance by objective (ecu million) 1996 in the context of the 1995-99 programming period programmes (year adopted) total cost s.f. assistance (1) commitments

the rechar, r\u00e9sider, retex or regis initiatives. two of the programmes were adopted in 1995 (employment and adapt). in 1996 the remaining programmes were adopted: smes, konver, urban, pesca, 2 for leader and 8 for interreg (1 together with denmark, 1 with finland, 2 with finland and norway, 3 with norway, 1 with finland, norway and russia). support for technological development potential in sweden : the swedish programme for the sme initiative gives priority to making small businesses more competitive through the use of new technologies. it stresses the importance of analysing the technological needs of businesses, and provides support for technology transfer and application. these measures, which have been allocated ecu 4.5 million (total cost: ecu 14.4 million) develop the role of new technologies in reducing geographical disadvantages and creating opportunities for small businesses. information technologies also play a role in some of the industrial conversion initiatives. the konver programme in karlskoga encourages the application of existing technological capacity for non-military purposes through cooperation between businesses and research centres via the centre for technological development, while in karlsborg it supports the creation of small businesses, all through the development and diffusion of technology (e.g. creation of networks) and training in technologies and business management (e.g. training in specialized technologies, distance learning, etc.). the interreg programmes treat the new technologies as a way of developing cross-border cooperation: \u0142 between sweden and norway: improving communications and using new technologies in the media, training and investment in information technologies, innovative activities in small businesses, developing joint information systems on the labour market (inre skandinavia programme); technological cooperation between businesses, universities, local authorities and training institutions, the extension of communication and telecommunications networks and distance learning ( \"no frontiers\" programme); \u0142 between sweden and denmark: measures to promote new technologies under priorities for industrial development, the media, rtd and higher education. the leader programmes also take advantage of new technologies (remote marketing, communications, commercial management, new services and businesses, distance learning, etc.). in particular, the provide for the development of investment and training.in information technologies. the urban programme supports the facklan development centre at malmo, which provides support for new businesses in the sphere of the media and technological equipment, the culture and media centre at augustenborgsskolan and four information centres which organize workshops and training in communications and the media, video conferences, etc. finally, adapt encourages the development of technology applications in small businesses and the development of networks between private individuals, businesses, organisations and research institutes. most of the programmes for sweden were adopted in 1996, with a total of six national programmes and eight interreg programmes. of the latter, one programme involves sweden and denmark, one sweden and finland, two programmes have been implemented between sweden, finland and norway, another between sweden, finland, norway and russia, and three between sweden and norway. the first series of meetings on seven programmes were held in october 1996 (the only exception was the sweden/denmark programme, for which the first meeting was held earlier). the urban programme, adopted in december, concerns the city of malm\u00f4. it affects 22 000 inhabitants and will be used to finance an integrated set of economic, social and infrastructural operations with the aim of creating two to three hundred new jobs and setting up 25 new businesses. the sme programme, which was adopted in july, covers all objective 2, 5(b) and 6 regions and areas and has three priorities: the development of markets for small businesses, more extensive use of new technologies in small businesses and encouraging the use of environmental quality as a way of increasing competitiveness. the konver programme, which covers the municipalities of karlskoga in the \u00f4rebro district and karlsborg in the skaraborg district, was approved in july 1996, while two leader programmes were adopted in june and the other in july, covering objective 5(b) areas and objective 6 regions respectively. under the 5(b) nine local action groups were selected, and under the objective 6 programme, three. they all started up their activities before the end of the year. finally, the pesca programme, adopted in march, covers 16 municipalities dependent on fisheries outside the objective 6 area, principally on the western coast of sweden. a limited number of projects were submitted and selected in 1996, but the monitoring committee held meetings during the year. 280 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) the only two progranimes approved in 1995 were the employment and adapt programmes. in 1996, under the employment initiative, 47 projects were selected (10 under now, 25 under horizon and 12 under youthstart). many of them, particularly under now and horizon, have an emphasis on job creation and the potential for self-employment. under youthstart the emphasis is on ways of motivating and supporting young people by developing their sense of initiative. under adapt 24 projects were selected in 1996. they concentrate principally on the staff of small businesses. the priorities concern identifying new ways of organizing work, developing employee skills in sectors where information technologies play an important role, developing new forms of training in the work place, creating jobs in areas with low populations and encouraging women to go into or improve their position in business. finally an extra ecu 15.8 million from the community initiative reserve has been allocated to sweden as additional funding. it will be shared among all the initiatives except sme and konver, but more than half of it will go to interreg75. table v-56: sweden - community initiatives (ecu million) 1996 in the context of the 1995-99 programming period

kingdom objective i: most of the priorities in the three spds allocate an important role to technology development (7.9% of all community funding). in the case of rtd: \u0142 highlands and islands: improved marketing through information technologies (ecu 2.3 million; total volume: ecu 4.6 million), rtd in small businesses (ecu 6 million; total volume: ecu 18.7 million), and environmental research; \u0142 northern ireland: within the priority devoted to economic development are the programmes complete and science and technology, establishment of networks for disseminating technology and strengthening of research (ecu 31.9 million), and development of technology infrastructures (ecu 25.7 million; total volume: ecu 41 million \u0142 e.g. research centres, demonstration projects, calibrating and evaluation) and training in the new technologies (ecu 25 million; total volume: ecu 38.5 million), and environmental research. outside this priority, research is also an essential element in the strategy for developing human resources (ecu 3.8 million; total volume: ecu 5.8 million), transport and local infrastructure (ecu 9.8 million; total volume: ecu 13.6 million), agriculture and rural development (ecu 7.1 million; total volume: ecu 15.5) and protection of the environment; \u0142 on merseyside: a whole priority (ecu 62 million; total volume: ecu 172 million) is being devoted to the development of advanced technologies and advanced industries. support is going to research, technology and innovation at the service of businesses (including development of new products and processes), commercialising of research activities, participation in programmes of research and creation of new high-technology firms. support is also going to developing clean technologies and to training in new techniques of environmental management, as well as training in the new technologies (e.g. encouraging science and technologyhn education centres, identifying industry needs,-establishing links between industry and the education sector, developing training centres for advanced technologies). in the case of the information technologies, their development in the highlands and islands (ecu 8.1 million; total volume: ecu 36.4 million) includes defining the needs of firms and the impact of it on the region, developing services based on the information technologies (for instance tourism), and improving access to and use of advanced telecommunications by firms and local authorities and developing support services to help absorb it and communications technology. turning to data-transmission applications, in the highlands and islands the emphasis is on distance learning and links between mobile units (ecu 4.4 million, total volume: ecu 8.8 million), while on merseyside the emphasis is on advanced data-transmission networks within and between local businesses and on networks providing information about new technologies. objective 2 (1994-96): all spds except the one for gibraltar contain schemes to support technology development and in particular support for rtd. 10 spds make stimulating rtd a separate priority covering either the development of advanced technologies and high-skill industries or research and technology/innovation76. in detail, these priorities include: \u0142 development of research and technology to meet the needs of small businesses and industry (eastern scotland, west midlands, greater manchester, lancashire and cheshire), innovation in small businesses and industry (east midlands, western scotland, eastern scotland, east london and the lee valley, industrial south wales, yorkshire and humberside) and technology transfers for small businesses, including aid for the development of new products and processes (east london and the lee valley, greater manchester, lancashire and cheshire, plymouth, west cumbria and furness, yorkshire and humberside, east midlands); \u0142 strengthening skills in the fields of technology and innovation (eastern scotland, east midlands, eastern scotland, west midlands and north east of england, east london and the lee valley, 76 by region, the funding breaks down

environment by reinforcing skills in advanced and environmental technologies (west midlands) and assistance for the introduction of clean technologies in businesses (north east of england, plymouth, industrial south wales, west cumbria and furness, east midlands, west midlands). in thanet, a priority devoted to industry and services contains a programme for the development and transfer of technologies, and the spd for western scotland also devotes a scheme to applied research, technology development and innovation in the context of a strategy for developing regional businesses. in the field of telecommunications and data-transmission technologies, most spds provide support for their development. for instance, the spd for the east midlands is supporting projects for disseminating advanced telecommunications services (such as information about the availability of services, help with local access to them, etc.) and the spd for greater manchester, lancashire and cheshire is encouraging participation in the information superhighways. the programmes for yorkshire and humberside and east london and the lee valley are providing support for advanced data-transmission services to strengthen high-skill industries and the adoption of data transmission technologies by small businesses and as well as training in advanced data-transmission services. in total, the funding from the structural funds for technology development comes to 9.8% of total community funding (objectives i, 2, 5(b)). table v-57: united kingdom - funding directly linked to technology development in the

fund of its kind to qualify for erdf support in the united kingdom. the number of eaggf-funded schemes is very small and mainly involves 77 eligible areas: northern ireland, merseyside, highlands and islands. 8tk annual report on the structural funds (1996) 283 objective 5(a); progress has been slow and it has been decided not to pursue the scheme for the processing and marketing sector (regulation (eec) no 866/90). an intermediate assessment of the spd was carried out in 1996 by independent assessors, who indicated three improvements that could be made: the procedures for approving applications for funding from the erdf and esf should be speeded up; the integration between the erdf and the esf and between various schemes could be enhanced; projects should be considered in a wider context in order to encourage a more strategic use of funding for the environment, data transmission and growth sectors and areas such as the centre of liverpool. the assessors concluded that the programme is basically on course to attain its overall targets in terms of new jobs and raising gdp, but that the quantification of targets in the spd could be improved and refined. work has started on proposals for amending the text and funding profile of the spd. example of a project on merseyside familiarisation with science and technology in schools: this project is running from 1996 to 1998 and is designed to develop knowledge about careers, in science and technology, scientific and engineering know-how and the links between schools and the science and technology industries. for instance, some pupils spent a week at the centre for alternative technology of mid-wales monitoring the energy consumption and electricity use of their group. in another example, several schools have developed training activities for teachers in the field of new technologies, including it, or have sent teachers into industrial firms to improve their knowledge of various technologies so that they can include them in classroom work. the project is being part-financed by the esf with about ecu 127 000; the total volume is ecu 375 700 and 2 636 individuals will be involved. fie. v-71: proerammine

animal welfare, diversification of holdings) are operational except those concerning the environment and woodland management, and financial implementation has kept to the financing plan. a number of innovations have been introduced into the programme management. the three-tier structure for the monitoring and implementation of the programme has been reduced to two tiers, a single monitoring committee and its consultative working parties. thirteen local groups have also been created to define local strategies. two studies, one on the environmental impact of the programme and one on local economic development, have been funded under technical assistance. finally, the intermediate assessment of the spd has begun, with an independent consultant being designated in november. the first assessment report is expected in april 1997. 284 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) fie. v-72: proerammine 1994-99 (ecu million): northern ireland priorities: economic development (a)

improving the environment and developing tourism has reached the different targets, and decisions taken on routing of the trans-european networks will ensure that expenditure can be programmed. the underwater gas pipeline from scotland has been terminated but the electricity interconnector has been delayed by planning problems. implementation of the agricultural and rural development schemes has been uneven, influenced by a loss of confidence among farmers due to the bse crisis. while the civil unrest during the summer temporarily slowed progress on the programme for the physical and social environment, the process of consultation and partnership begun under the 'peace' community initiative has continued, making a valuable contribution to social cohesion in the region. a round of reprograniming took place in october but the preference was to hold back the additional money arising out of indexation until the results of the intermediate assessment were available in mid-1997. for the latter exercise, assessors have been appointed for each subprogramme and one for the whole of the spd, including coordination of the subprogramme assessments, and the subprogramme reports were already available by the end of the year. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 the stage reached in financial implementation varies according to spd. in the case of the programme for merseyside, cornmitment of the 1996 tranche from the erdf could not take place because actual spending had been too little - only 1% - to trigger the erdf contribution. by the end of the year, however, payments under the erdf had come to ecu 109 million, about 23% of the total erdf allocation. in the case of the programme for the highlands and islands, comrnitments speeded up during the year so that the 1996 tranche was committed. by the end of 1996, payments under the erdf had come to ecu 39 million in total, about 22% of the erdf allocation. finally, in the case of northern ireland spending in 1996 slightly exceeded the year's targets, but although the outturn was comparable to 1995 some reprogramming was necessary to offset the under-implementation in 1994. payments still reached 40% of the total allocation for the period. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 285 objective 278 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-96 fir. v-73: proerammine 1994-96

wound up. erdf payments came in all to almost ecu 711 million by the end of the year, corresponding to more than 47% of the total erdf allocation to all programmes. the winding-up of commitments none the less meant that transfers had to be made to the next phase. all the regions except gibraltar had to carry over unused appropriations to the 1997-99 prograrnming period, a total of ecu 155 million (at 1996 prices; ecu 109.4 million from the erdf and ecu 45.6 million from the esf). in two instances (manchester-lancashire-cheshire and west midlands) only the esf was involved, but both funds were concerned in all the other cases. the transfer total amounted to 7% of the original allocation under objective 2 to all programmes in the united kingdom, although the carryover varied considerably according to region (from less than 1% in the case of greater manchester-lancashire to 37% in the case of thanet). the greater levels of under-implementation did not necessarily mean, however, that spending was less efficient but reflected the concern of the regions to avoid committing funds too quickly where applications needed careful vetting to ensure that resources were in line with the strategic needs of the regional economy. programmes were also amended to take account of indexation and to undertake some reprogi-mming. no decision on indexation had been taken before 1996, so that application of the deflator led to an increase for all programmes of ecu 30.5 million over initial allocations (ecu 24.3 million under the erdf and ecu 6.2 million under the esf). reprogramming took two forms: transfers between years and transfers between schemes, the latter only being agreed where the regional partnerships could provide a strategic justification in terms of new jobs. turning to progress on the ground, one innovation has been approval of several venture-capital funds. the fund approved under the spd for yorkshire and humberside, in particular, is confined to this region but others are being supported in other regions. nine major projects under article 16(2) of the coordination regulation have been notified to and approved by the commission79. results have varied according to region. for example, the priority \"new community economic development\" (ced, i.e. local economic development) has continued to encounter problems in eastern scotland and industrial south wales, but has been particularly productive of new jobs in east london. other priorities in the field of innovation, for example environmental technologies, have made considerable progress in yorkshire and humberside and, after a slower start, in greater manchester-lancashire-cheshire. 78 eligible areas: eastern scotland, western scotland, east midlands, gibraltar, east london & the lee

report on the structural funds (1996) some new features have been added to the management of programmes. the annual reports, most of them presented during the year, have adopted a new format as proposed by the commission in 1995. this has generally led to a marked improvement in the content and quality of these reports. implementation of the programmes will have to cope with the local government reorganisation in the united kingdom. for example, strathclyde regional council has been replaced by twelve different local authorities, with implications for the implementation of the western scotland programme. the reorganisation of local government is continuing and will probably have repercussions on other programmes in the 1997-99 period. technical assistance has been used in several cases to finance a reinforcement of various functions of the monitoring committees and their secretariats. ta also made it possible to support studies to back up the implementation of programmes, analyse local training needs and survey project selection procedures in the north-east, as well as demand for industrial sites and premises in eastern scotland. the commission also published a study on the implementation of innovative local development schemes in the united kingdom programmes (\"social and economic inclusion through regional development\"), the results of which were presented at a national conference. the uk government also made a study of structural fund management in england and proposed various reforms, the main features of which are simplified procedures for part-financing by the national authorities and the introduction of local action plans. preparations for 1997-99 a basic task in 1996 was preparing, proposing and negotiating new programmes for the 1997-99 prograrriming period. the eligible regions remain unchanged. the total of structural fund money available is ecu 2.5 billion. draft conversion plans for each of the regions were tabled in august, assessed by independent experts, and then discussed in terms of actual programmes in meetings starting in october and november. one of the aspects discussed was greater involvement of the partnership compared with the previous period at all stages of the procedure, starting with the preparation of conversion plans; these talks were launched at the beginning of the summer in seminars held in some of the regions. this involvement was maintained in the detailed discussions which took place subsequently during the year, in which the main partners participated along with central and local government officials. major progress was made by the end of the year in discussions with the regions, and agreement was reached with the partners to structure the programmes according to the priorities set out in the commission's communication for this objective. the main goals of the commission in its meetings with the regions were in particular to maximise the creation of new jobs, to concentrate on promoters of change in each region, to develop more fully the priorities of local development (set for the first time in 1994), to continue reducing the share of the erdf funds spent on infrastructure, to identify major physical investments better in terms of geographical location and link them into the local economy, to ensure better integration of erdf and esf, and to start schemes in the priority areas of the environment, innovation and equal opportunities. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 287 objective 3 fig. v-74: objective 3 - programming 1994-99 (ecu million

1994-96 and contained assistance worth ecu 1.501 billion at 1994 prices. the 1996 tranche was worth ecu 539 million. the spd was implemented with funding contributed by central government and each of the following sectors, all of them represented on the monitoring committee: local authorities, the training and enterprise councils, higher education and adult education establishments, and the voluntary sector. in 1996, there were 8 000 projects receiving funding, of which 10% were being managed by voluntary bodies, and so far 90% of the funding has gone to training schemes (many of the projects also involve an element of counselling and work experience). implementation has continued to encounter problems, however, because of the apparent difficulty the various sectors have in meeting the financial requirements for each scheme in the programme. modifications were once again requested in financing plans so that projects could continue, and this often delayed payments as a result of the necessary amendment procedures. in other words, the financing plans continue to be used more as accounting instruments than strategic management tools. finally, discussions on the new spd for 1997-99 began in spring 1996 and the new programme was adopted in december. it introduces a regionalised implementation structure and a system for targeting within schemes so as to reinforce the concentration of funding and encourage integrated projects. objective 5(a) agriculture table v-58: proerammine implementation 1994-99 (ecu million total 185,7 measures production marketing 134,5

in 1996, allowances were paid to holdings accounting for a total of 4 million hectares, the community contribution being ecu 24.4 million. support for less-favoured areas goes to cattle and sheep farmers. under other aid schemes, now wound up, a total of 2 600 beneficiaries continue to receive investment aid and other types of assistance representing 5% of eaggf expenditure in 1996 under objective 5(a). in the area of support for processing and marketing of agricultural products, the authorities in england have had problems providing public funding for the aid scheme because of government spending limits. here the united kingdom has been authorised to confine the scheme to projects submitted before the end of march 1996, while in scotland and wales the aid scheme will remain in place until the end of 1999. the original amount of the community contribution (ecu 227 million) has been reduced to ecu 51.2 million. by the end of 1996, 177 projects had been approved (69% in england, 16% in scotland and 15% in wales), mainly in the sectors involving meat (46), fruit and vegetables (43), potatoes (28) and milk (27). the total eligible volume of these projects is ecu 130 million and 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 29 provided for the first phase, 89% was committed, and 47% paid. the objectives where most progress has been made on implementation are objectives 1 and 6 and objective 3, with over half the financing cornmitted and one third paid. next come objectives 5(a), for both agriculture and fisheries, for which between 40% and 50% of the financing was committed and a little over a quarter paid, implementation is least advanced under objectives 5(b) and 4, where less than a third of the financing has been committed, and less than a quarter paid. there are also wide differences between member states. in four member states (the united kingdom, portugal, spain, ireland) rates of corrimitment exceed 50% of assistance, and in a further seven member states (denmark, luxembourg, france, germany, the netherlands, greece, belgium) the rate is between 40% and 50%, ranging from 43% to 49% (denmark and luxembourg are both above the average, which is 48%). only four member states, italy and the new member states, have cornmitment rates under 40%, but even here the rate exceeds one third of available financing. this situation is broadly repeated on the payments side, with rates of 40% or over in three member states (the united kingdom, portugal, ireland), and rates between 30% and 40% in seven member states (spain, denmark, luxembourg, germany, france, the netherlands, greece), of which the first four mentioned are above the average of 33%. in three member states (belgium, italy, austria) the rate of payment is between 20% and 30%, while in the remaining two new member states (finland and sweden) implementation.is below 20%. table 1-3: csfs/spds -1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99- (ecu million)

potential of the regions financing to encourage the technological development of the regions (research-development, innovation, information society) has been significantly increased in current programmes, as mentioned in the introduction. the overall volume of financing increased from about ecu 3.5 billion to ecu 7.6 billion, or 7% of all community financing. the increase is more marked in the objective 1 regions than in those covered by the other objectives, because the initial level of financing was lower. there are wide differences from one objective and from one member state to another. for all objectives taken together, of the easily identifiable types of financing, the two most significant are financing for rtd and for telecommunications, which account respectively for 81% and 12% of community financing for rtd and innovation; however, their relative weight varies from one objective to another. for objectives 1 and 6, rtd represents 83% of structural fund financing, followed by investment in telecommunications with 15% of appropriations. in areas eligible under objectives 2 and 5(b), a major share (over a quarter of community appropriations) goes to support the development of data transmission and investment in telecommunications, all directly linked to the information society. table 1-4: csfs/spds - financing of technological development in the 1994-96/99

approach into the general strategy for implementing programmes. these plans were also designed to simplify local administrative problems due to the involvement of a large number of authorities. in other regions, attempts for improve programme management were less radical. in most of the regions the criteria for selecting projects were refined to enhance performance and pick the best projects. progress in terms of financial implementation continued to be slow, reflecting in the case of commitments the low uptake of funds. the mid-term assessments will provide the commission with independent assessments of progress with the programmes. the terms of reference for -these assessments were adopted by the monitoring committees by the end of the year and some of them have already been started.

involved in all the community initiatives except regis, to which should be added the 'peace' programme for northern ireland. in all, 28 community initiative programmes for the uk were approved in 1994 and 1995, joining three interreg programmes adopted in 1995. there were 13 other programmes still to be adopted, one for smes, one under r\u00e9sider, nine under urban and two under interreg shared with france. all these initiative programmes except the sme programme for england were adopted in 1996. regarding northern ireland, which is eligible under objective 1, all the regionalised programmes covering it were adopted in 1995, i.e. those under urban, peace, retex, smes, employment, adapt and leader. the programmes under konver and pesca cover the united kingdom as a whole. support for development of technology potential in the united kingdom the four sme initiative programmes already approved give priority to the use of advanced telecommunications and to rtd in increasing the competitiveness of businesses. in the case of telecommunications, ecu 3 million (total volume: ecu 6.7 million) are going to northern ireland to assist small businesses in identifying their advanced telecommunications needs and doubling their use. in the lowlands region, an awareness campaign in advanced telecommunications is being funded (ecu 1.6 million. 290 8th annual report on the structural funas (1996) total volume: ecu 3.8 million), while in the highlands and islands a scheme is being supported to develop information sources by satellite using advanced telecommunications as a means of creating networks among businesses. in the field of rtd, the stress is on cooperation among businesses (northern ireland) or between businesses and research centres in order to strengthen technology transfers (highlands and islands, lowlands, wales), and on innovation (lowlands). the national programme under konver also makes provision for encouraging technology transfers and cooperation between small businesses, centres of research, universities and centres of technology transfer with a view to reinforcing the quality and flexibility of the links between firms and their suppliers and to help create networks among small businesses. technology is to be used to enhance the competitiveness of businesses and to make various areas less dependent on defence activities and other traditional industries by developing civilian applications for advanced military technologies. turning to the community initiatives dealing with human resources, the adapt programmes aim to facilitate technology transfers towards the sectors most affected by changes in employment patterns. staff of research bodies are being assisted in training firms to solve detailed technical problems, and support is also going to research connected with industrial change (innovative technologies, new production systems, it and communications systems). the adapt programmes also include schemes to disseminate information, raise technology awareness, develop databases on employment and set up infrastructure for transmitting data. under the employment initiative, the horizon schemes are targeted on adapting workplaces for the handicapped using new technologies (e.g. telecommuting for the handicapped), on using information technologies and interactive video for training purposes, and on training teachers how to adapt new technologies for handicapped users. the programmes under leader also contain several schemes to support technology development, in particular data transmission services and information on technology. support is being given for distance learning, distance working, internet connections between businesses and 'telecottage' centres for use by small businesses, craft firms and service companies in order to improve access to services and cooperation among distributors, producers and suppliers. the main developments in 1996 were the approval of ten new programmes and allocations from the community initiatives reserve fund. nine of the new programmes approved come under the urban initiative. the largest covers three urban areas on merseyside (north huyton, liverpool central and netherton). by the end of the year, practically all the monitoring committees responsible for implementing this initiative in each city area had been set up and a series of discussions had taken place with a view to creating or further developing local urban partnerships and preparing the first urban action plans. the r\u00e9sider operational programme for england was also approved. implementation of this initiative was subsequently delayed by a disagreement, now resolved, over the participation of local elected politicians on the monitoring committee. all of the additional funding available from the community initiatives reserve fund, totalling ecu 188.8 million for the united kingdom, was allocated among the initiatives with the exception of the smes initiative and peace, most of the money going to employment, konver, urban and adapt81. a proposal setting out how to employ these resources was submitted by the uk authorities in july but no decision has been taken. turning to programmes adopted in previous years, and first of all the leader programmes, 31 of the 33 intended local action groups had been selected by the end of the year. progress has varied considerably, with the groups which benefited from experience of leader i being the most advanced (wales, south west england, dumfries and galloway in scotland). however, the new groups have also made progress, although major efforts had to be devoted to getting the groups up and running and developing programmes. the national network of leader groups, for which the commission has proposed part-finance of ecu 0,7 million up to the end of 1999, has still to be formed. in the case of the programme under pesca, which was adopted in june 1995, progress has been slow but most of the difficulties encountered in setting up its management and procedures have been overcome. under the employment initiative, a total of 262 projects has been approved and launched in 1996. the number of projects in great britain (i.e. excl. northern ireland) is 239 projects (81 projects under now, 104 under horizon and 54 under youthstart). the projects under now mainly concern the certification of skills acquired and financial support for child-minding facilities. the projects under youthstart are aimed for the most part at enhancing the basic qualifications of young people and developing less formal training-pathways. in the case of horizon, the projects for handicapped people 81 see also chapter i.b.i. community initiatives. 8th annual report on the structural fund<: (1996) ^ 29/ focus on the use of new technologies, transition to non-sheltered employment and awareness campaigns, while the projects for deprived groups also aim at less formal training pathways, with special attention given to single parents and migrant workers. in both strands, the majority of projects are based on, or include, direct training schemes and about a quarter seek to develop systems of training, guidance, counselling and employment. in northern ireland, the number of projects selected under employment is 23 (7 projects under now, 11 under horizon, 5 under youthstart). examples of now projects are training for trade-union staff and women in rural areas, the acquisition of management skills and training in new technologies. among the horizon projects are programmes for the pre-vocational and vocational integration of the mentally handicapped, while under youthstart there is a programme of training in new technologies based on multimedia products. under adapt, a total of 87 projects have been approved. in great britain (excl. northern ireland) most of the 83 projects, as under employment, involve training schemes, counselling and guidance, followed by projects to adjust support structures and systems. all the projects focus on strengthening the structure of local small businesses and improving their competitiveness. the main topics are the information society, teleworking, the creation of new jobs and flexible forms of training. in northern ireland, four projects have been selected and involve, for example, the introduction of technologies for exchanging data within small businesses and training in the craft industries leading to qualifications meeting industry standards. as part of the preparations for a second series of calls for proposals under employment and adapt in 1997, about twenty events within and between various sectors were organised with the cooperation of regional and industry bodies, helping potential applicants to learn about the priorities for the initiatives, the timetable and procedures. as regards the initiatives dealing with industrial conversion, above all rechar, the first pan of the year was devoted to setting up monitoring committees and making administrative arrangements for each regional programme. implementation of these programmes has been without major problems, and as an example it is worth noting the approach taken in north east of england, namely an action plan and strategic plans for each county in the eligible area. the konver programme has made satisfactory progress, although payments have been a little slower. the same applies to retex. in the case of the smes initiative, as under the other initiatives a part of the year was spent setting up the monitoring committees. calls for project proposals were issued under the programmes for the lowlands of scotland and wales. the uk authorities have still not submitted a proposed programme for england.. as for interreg, finally, 1996 was the first full year of implementation of the wales-ireland programme. major development work and frequent exchanges of experience were necessary to get the programme up and running, but all the projects except those for transport infrastructure in ireland are joint projects with participation from ireland and wales. the programme involving gibraltar and morocco, which was approved in december 1995, saw its implementation held up in 1996 by difficulties over detailing the administrative arrangements required. 292 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) table v-60: united kingdom -

1 and 6 in 1996 the forms of assistance still awaiting approval were adopted in 1996: 18 altogether, representing a contribution from the structural funds of ecu 1 331 million (77% erdf, 19% eaggf, 3% esf). these measures comprise 11 ops (1 in greece, 6 in spain, 1 in ireland and 3 in italy), 4 global grants (2 in spain and 2 in italy), and 3 major projects (spain). they represent only 1.4% of total assistance adopted for the period 1994-99, and are much fewer in number than the programming documents adopted in 1995 (26) and especially in 1994, when the present programming period was launched (141). objectives 1 and 6 are programmed through 6 csfs and 14 spds. the various forms of assistance now number 185 spds, ops, global grants or major projects. as to the breakdown of financing between different funds, it is worth noting the following points. \u0142 almost one quarter of the forms of assistance (but 29% of total financing) involve financing from three of the funds, if not all four. fourteen programmes are financed by all four funds (including 12 spds in belgium, france, the netherlands, finland, sweden, and the united kingdom). these fourteen programmes represent 8% of the number of programmes, but a volume of financing of 11% of the total contribution. thirty-one measures are financed from three funds (17% of the total number, and 18% of total appropriations), with the predominant combination being joint financing by the erdf, the esf and the eaggf (30 programmes) and one programme receiving financing from the erdf, the esf and the fefg. \u0142 on the other hand, 102 measures, or 55% of measures but 43% of total financing, are financed by a single fund. they comprise 60 erdf measures (32% of the total of 185 forms of assistance), including 7 global grants and 5 major projects, 22 esf ops, 17 eaggf ops and 3 fifg ops. \u0142 there are 38 measures financed by two funds. they represent 21% of assistance measures, but 28% of total financing. most of them are ops under the erdf and the esf (32 measures), with the others being financed either by the erdf and the eaggf (4 measures), or by the esf and the eaggf (2 measures), or by the erdf and the fifg (1 measure). the implementation of the various forms of assistance is predominantly regionalised. regional measures account for 106 out of a total of 185, i.e. 57%, breaking down as follows. \u0142 spds represent 13% of the total, in contrast with the 92 ops, global grants or major projects within csfs. \u0142 of the 92 regional measures within csfs, almost half are in spain (43), and none at all in ireland. \u0142 the member states where regional programmes account for the highest percentage of the total number of programmes for implementing the csf are germany (89% of the csf), and spain (67%); these are the only two member states where over half the measures in the csf are implemented as regional programmes. \u0142 the ratio between the regional programmes and the csf as a whole in terms of the volume of financing is substantially similar, although slightly less than that for the number of measures: 52% of the financing under csfs is implemented under regionalised measures. \u0142 the proportion of financing implemented regionally is once again highest in germany (over 92% of appropriations within the csf) and spain (62%). in two member states, greece and portugal, the share of regional programmes in total appropriations (33% and 18% respectively) is considerably smaller than the number of regionalised programmes relative to total programmes within the csf (41% in both cases). 298 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) table 1: financial implementation by objective in 1996 * table 1.4: objective 4 - csf member state belgium

csf\u00bb \u0161 op.spd.gg.mp after the first three years of the programming period, the forms of assistance adopted accounted for the full amount of financing provided for objectives 1 and 6 and for each member state. implementation as a percentage of total assistance is progressing, since almost half the assistance was committed and one third paid. 1996 was the best year for implementation since 1994, providing further confirmation of the tendency to make up for the time lost at the beginning of the period. commitments are an indicator of the launching of new measures at community level and on the ground; those made in 1996 represented 36% of total commitments made between 1994 and 1996, compared with 30% in 1994, and 34% in 1995. most significantly, payments really began to take off in 1996, showing that measures were being carried out on the ground. 1996 accounted for 44% of total payments made since 1994, compared with 22% in 1994 and 34% in 1995. however, it must be recognised that the slow start in 1994 and also to some extent in 1995 has not yet been fully offset, at least in certain member states. some countries have already committed the 1997 instalment for certain programmes (some german lander, greece, ireland, portugal, northern ireland). however, others have been able to commit the 1996 instalment only on the basis of reprogi_mming (italy, france), which cut financing for the first two years to the actual take-up level, and increased financing for subsequent years. table 1-8: objectives 1 and 6 - implementation 1994 to 1996 (ecu million) b d el e f irl i

whole, 1996 was certainly a year of catching up for financial implementation, since the amounts committed in 1996 represented 41% of commitments for the three-year period, compared with 31% of the total committed in 1994 and 27% in 1995. this applies even more to payments, since the appropriations paid in 1996 represented 45% of all appropriations between 1994 and 1996, with payments in 1994

to another. in two .of the original member states (luxembourg, spain), the rate of implementation of adjusted assistance was over 60%, it was over 50% in another two member states (united kingdom, france) and over 40% in four member states (germany, italy, denmark, the netherlands). only in belgium was the implementation rate for payments as a proportion of adjusted assistance below 40%. of the new member states, finland has a very good rate of implementation of payments \u0161 over 50% in two years \u0161- while rates of payment for austria and sweden are below 40% (at one third and one quarter respectively), but programming covers the period 1995-99. the commission has decided, pursuant to article 9 of the framework regulation, to transfer, by means of a formal commission decision reducing assistance for 1994-96, appropriations not taken up by the end of the period 1994-96 to programmes for 1997-99 for the same regions, thus making for easier financial management and avoiding overlapping between the two phases of prograjriming for objective 2. the proportion of initial assistance transferred varies considerably from one member state to another. for three of the original member states (denmark, germany, the united kingdom), it stands at between 5% and 7%. in three member states (spain, france, belgium), transfers account for less than 20%, with spain and france at the average level for the nine countries concerned. for a further three member states (italy, luxembourg, netherlands), transfers represent a quarter of the initial assistance. for the new member states, only finland programmed objective 2 in two phases (1995-96 and 1997-99); it also transferred an appreciable fraction of the appropriations to 1997-99 (21%). transfers for the french and italian programmes alone represented 45% of total objective 2 appropriations transferred (while the share of these countries in total assistance is 35%). with the addition of the transfers for the spanish and united kingdom programmes, the total for these four member states represents 80% of transfers for the ten member states (which is comparable to the share of the four member states concerned in objective 2 assistance as a whole). 3.3. preparing for the period 1997-99 in the context of objective 2, a large part of the year was spent preparing for the second phase of programming in 1997-99. in accordance with article 9 of the framework regulation, the commission established the list of regions eligible under objective 2 for the period 1997-999 in the nine member states concerned10 on 26 july 1996, after receiving a favourable opinion from the advisory committee on the development and conversion of regions. the list is the same as the one for the period 1994-96, with the exception of a few minor changes in italy, the netherlands and spain, where the extension of eligibility to certain areas of the madrid region brought in areas inhabited by a further 5 000 people. as this increase was offset by a reduction in zaragoza, however, the population eligible under objective 2 as a percentage of total population has not changed, and it remains constant within each member state. the overall percentage covered is still 16.4% of total population of the union. total financing available between 1997 and 1999 is ecu 8 147 million (at 1996 prices), a real increase of 13.8% in relation to the period 1994-96, as decided by the edinburgh european council. on 19 july, the commission had established the indicative allocation of commitment appropriations by member state for 1997 to

the commission sent the member states guidelines for preparing new programmes for the second phase 1997-99. job creation was to be the paramount priority in the new programmes, and was to be achieved by improving production structures and raising qualification levels in the labour force. this general aim should be supported through four priorities: competitiveness and development of smes, which means paying special attention to locally-generated potential and exploiting local potential through local development and employment initiatives; research and development and innovation (see, box); environment and sustainable development, targeted especially on remedying the damage caused by industry and on exploiting eco-products and environmental services; and finally, equal opportunities for men and women, with the central issue of reconciling working and family life. promotion of technological innovation: apriority under objective 2 for 1997-99 one of the four priorities in the commission's guidelines for the preparation of programmes for 1997-99 is research and development along with innovation. the guidelines stress the importance of r&d in increasing competitiveness, and they encourage the regions to seek greater synergy and effectiveness from actions for research, development and innovation, and to establish regional innovation and technological development strategies. specifically, the commission urges that programmes should aim at taking advantage of certain factors: \u0142 better use should be made of those facilities which already exist in the area for industrial research: such facilities are usually already in place in objective 2 areas, and they provide a basis for improvingoperation between firms and research institutes in areas such as production processes, the introduction of advanced technologies and new product development; \u0142 priority should be given to the practical application of research results and the transfer of technological innovations to local business and industry; \u0142 innovation should be encouraged, not only in terms of technology but also, since it underpins the emergence of new sectors of economic activity, in terms of human and organisational factors, especially in relation to the capacity of firms to absorb technology and their access to information regarding customer needs for new products and services; \u0142 the emphasis in small firms should be on practical ict applications services within firms, and measures to raise awareness, disseminate best practices and improve information services, and set up co-operation networks between firms for the transmission of data; \u0142 training of workers should concentrate on specific measures to encourage adjustment and raise awareness of the new technological environment with special reference to the increasing links between service sector activities and industrial production. initial information available on the programmes prepared by the member states in the last quarter of 1996 indicates that the rtd effort has been substantially increased, rising to over 18% of community financing for the period 1997-99. the commission guidelines also highlight a number of ways in which the content and quality of conversion plans and programming documents for 1997-99 might be improved. they involve improved application of the principles of partnership and additionality, and the use of appropriately quantified impact indicators, especially as regards job creation. most of the member states' conversion plans were presented to the commission in august and september 1996; after prior appraisal, the preparation of spds began in october and lasted until early 1997. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 39 4. objectives 3 and 4 4.1. implementation of objectives 3 and 4 in 1996 1995 was not a full year of implementation for objective 3 because the csfs and spds of the three new member states were adopted in the course of the year; in 1996, however, all the programmes were established and implemented. although there was still some concern about the low level of commitments in certain member states, the implementation of objective 3 was encouraging.12 in most of the member states, the initial stage of implementation enabled the programmes to gather momentum and structures and aims were established. the advertising effort was a significant factor here. moreover, all the programmes were successful, to a varying extent, in achieving concentration of objective 3 measures on the most disadvantaged groups. in all the member states, the notion of \"integration pathways\" was reflected in practical measures. the results clearly show that integrated projects providing a wide range of aid, such as back-up, counselling and periods of work experience, attract much more attention than individual training measures. measures under objective 4 really got under way in late 1995 and early 1996, with a few exceptions (spain, ireland, luxembourg and finland, where the level of implementation was fairly high in 1995). the csf for belgium and the spds for denmark, germany, france, and luxembourg, which had been approved for 1994-96, were extended until 1999. the programming documents of the other member states (spain, italy, the netherlands) had been approved in 1994 for the entire period 1994-99. the spds for austria and finland, approved in july 1995, and that for sweden, approved in february 1996, also cover the period to 1999. a progress report on the implementation of objective 4 and adapt13 was sent at the end of 1996 to the council, the european parliament, the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions. according to that report, the main effects of implementing objective 4 were: to reinforce active labour market policies to reach workers in employment; the establishment and involvement of a wide partnership in the design, implementation and monitoring of actions; the organisation and strengthening of continuing training structures in a number of countries. it proposed addressing certain weaknesses in implementation. this means in particular reinforcing anticipation and linkage with training plans, the need to focus on smes and giving priority to the workers most at risk of unemployment as a result of industrial change. the promotion of technological innovation in the areas eligible under objectives 3 and 4: information technologies are an important factor in measures under objective 3, which encourages the emergence of job potential in the context of the information society. the relevant measures concern training to provide a wide range of basic it skills, often the first stage in the process of reintegration into the world of work, especially for people previously employed in traditional sectors or for young people. objective 3 measures also contribute to the development of more advanced skills to make full use of new technologies. example of project: the use of communications technologies in germany (objective 3). in kiel an association is helping women who wish to re-enter the labour market after dedicating several years to their families by providing them with a year's training in using information and communications techniques and project creation. working within social institutions, the women draw up the forma for information brochures, develop internet sites and produce and distribute calendars of events intended for children. their abilities are assessed at the beginning of the course and this provides the basis for individual training plans. the training is intended both to utilise information and communications technologies and to develop creativity and a sense of initiative among those taking part. the esf is contributing ecu 63 500 towards the total cost of the measure amounting to ecu 325 000. the esf regulation specifies that objective 4 \"should concentrate on operations in the areas of training related to the introduction, use and development of new or improved production methods, in particular new organisational techniques and new technologies \". thus a large part of the measures implemented under this 12 for more details, see chapter v. country-by-country survey. 13 sec(96) 2150. see also chapter v. country-by-country survey.

and communication technologies (ict). this may involve, for example, training relevant to the introduction of \"green \" technologies, design software and computer-assisted design, data transmission, the development of automated techniques, the application of ict, total quality management and the introduction of edi (electronic data interchanged between producers, suppliers and customers on the one hand, and contractors and subcontractors on the other; \u0142 the use of hew technologies as a basis for training measures in the context of improving training systems. this involves the application of ict to training methods and the design of new teaching tools (especially multimedia training techniques), and the development of co-operation networks between training institutes (public and private training establishments, scientific and research institutes, chambers of commerce, social partners, etc.). example of project: hypermedia training in finland (objective 4). the hypmed project is aimed at the staff of small firms in the region ofjyv\u00e0skyl\u00e2 and is being carried out jointly by the jyv\u00e0skyla technology centre ltd, firms and the research institute on information technologies of the university of jyv\u00e0skyla. it is intended to improve know-how among the staff of small firms in the sectors which are currently of greatest importance to the region (paper, energy, the environment, information and communications technology) to encourage them to use the hypermedia and devise their own applications, for example, in the areas of staff training and customers, product documentation and marketing. training in running a multimedia project is an integral part of the project and may be carried out alongside preparation for a university diploma. firms which took part in the first phase of training and which apply this technology will take part in a number of national and community research projects on multimedia and hypermedia technologies. 42. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994/95-96/99 table1-13: objectives 3 and 4 - 1996 in the context of programming for 1994/95-96/99 (ecu million) jul __l_ ____. j___ tntal

on the whole, and financial implementation was better in 1996 than in the two preceding years. in general, this progressive acceleration reflects the trends initially provided for in the multiannual programme budgets. however, the commitments and payments made by the commission are only an imperfect reflection of actual achievements and payments at the level of the member states. esf programmes are closed each year, and actual achievements for a given year are known only at the end of june of the following year, when the member states send the commission the annual reports on implementation. the commission's figures for financial implementation do, however, reflect a trend towards greater implementation. within this general tendency, -implementation of the programmes of the new member states (austria-finland and sweden), which were adopted in 1995, lag somewhat behind the general trend. the decline in payments for sweden and finland is more apparent than real, since the level of implementation actually rose in 1996. the table does not take account of the share of appropriations unused in the initial year of 1995, which was carried over to 1996, since these appropriations already paid were used for payments for measures carried out in 1996. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 41 table 1-14: objective 3 - implementation from 1994 to 1996 (ecu million) b dk

implementation of objective 4 was fairly low in 1994 and 1995. this was mainly because objective 4 is a new objective, because the problems of industrial change are complex, and because of the need to set up a wider partnership. all this made it necessary in most of the member states to raise awareness and provide information, and to support the setting up of projects. however, the rate of implementation did rise throughout 1996. measures are concentrated mainly on further training for workers, so as to improve their technological skills and their adaptation to new ways of organising

farming throughout the union and supporting the modernisation of agricultural structures. this ties it closely to the common agricultural policy. objective 5(a) measures are taken pursuant to specific regulations, the most important being regulation (eec) no 2328/91 for production structures, regulations (eec) no 866/90 and no 867/90 for marketing and processing of products, and regulation (eec) no 1360/78 for aid to producer groups. measures financed under objective 5(a) agriculture:14 objective 5(a) may be summarised as follows: competitiveness and employment: these two basic objectives are pursued through: aid for training,15 setting-up aid to young farmers,16 aid for investment in agricultural holdings,17 back-up measures to assist agricultural holdings (management services, self-help, accounting),18 aid to producer groups,19 investment aid for processing and marketing of agricultural and forestry products.20 territorial balance and employment: this objective is to be achieved in particular through specific measures to assist mountain and hill farming and farming in certain less-favoured areas,21, which are intended to compensate for the natural handicaps faced by farming in those areas. following amendments to several programming documents coming under regulations (eec) no 866/90 and no 867/90, and updating of the forecasts for expenditure under regulation (ec) no 2328/91, the indicative financial programming for objective 5(a) measures outside objective 1 and 6 regions22 for 1994-99, in force on 31 december 1996, is as follows: ____ 14 for more details, see annual reports for 1994 and 1995. 15 regulation (eec) no 2328/91, article 28. 16 regulation (eec) no 2328/91, articles 10 and 11. 17 regulation (eec) no 2328/91, articles 5 to 9. 18 regulation (eec)

and no 867/90 on improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural and forestry products contribute to the application of new processing techniques, which, in particular through innovative investment, help to develop new products and to open up new markets. a clear indication of the importance of these activities in the framework of the regulations is the priority given to such investment among the selection criteria governing the aid arrangements. although it is not the main purpose of the measures to encourage the development of new technologies, they have a major role to play in technology transfer, and in the practical application on an industrial or commercial scale of research and demonstration projects. they may, organise and facilitate the dissemination of technological innovation with a view to improving the competitiveness of production, processing and marketing of agricultural products. in practice, the measure offers the following opportunities: \u0142 the main aspect of the development of new products is the creation of new types of packaging, not only in response to evolving demand but also to contribute to improving product quality; \u0142 new markets are opened up by promoting products for non-food use, such as new packaging materials and products for the strengthening and treatment of plants (organic plant protection methods).

products as provided for in regulations (eec) no 866/90 and no 867/90 continued in the framework of prograirtining for 1994-99. the work of the monitoring committees showed that, after some delay getting started, the rate of implementation of programmes gathered pace in most of the member states. monitoring and assessment procedures continued to improve in the framework of partnership. more specifically, the implementation of measures in the italian csf led to the approval of 13 ops to improve the conditions for processing and marketing agricultural products and 12 ops for forestry products. objective 5(a) measures got under way in sweden when the spd was adopted in 1996. the spd for the united kingdom was amended in 1996 to take account of the decision to limit application of the measure to wales and scotland from 31 march 1996. there was also a council decision defining new less-favoured areas in ireland. this extension covers about 105 000 hectares and increases the less-favoured areas in ireland to 73% of total usable agricultural area. on 4 september 1996, the commission adopted a report on young farmers and the problem of succession in european agriculture for presentation to the council, to parliament and to the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions. this report, the commission's contribution to the debate on the establishment of young farmers, considers the economic, social, legal and fiscal difficulties encountered by new farmers. it goes on to examine the present community measures for promoting their installation and assisting young people in rural environments, describing how these are applied and with what results in the member states. proposals and recommendations are made for action at both community and national level to make help for young farmers in the community more consistent and effective. several member states have sent the commission their ideas on strengthening community policy in favour of mountain and hill-farming areas. the commission is continuing the dialogue with the member states on practical needs in the different mountain regions. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996)

the approval and implementation of programmes. in 1996, lost time was made up in most of the member states. in terms of financial commitments, this is reflected in the rate of implementation of the amount entered in the programmes, which rose to 84% in 1996 compared with 66% in 1995. for the whole range of programmes in force, budget commitments in 1996 represented 37% of commitments made between 1994 and 1996. the problems with implementation in 1996 were concentrated in certain countries, as most of the member states had achieved a normal rate of annual implementation. there are a number of reasons for the problems, and they vary from one member state to another. they include changes in the method of granting investment aid, technical problems arising at the beginning of the period of implementation in one of the three new member states and the lack of interest in the measures proposed among potential beneficiaries, owing to the difficult economic environment. the under-utilisation of appropriations explains why two member states in 1996, spain and luxembourg, transferred appropriations within objective 5(a) to measures relating to the processing and marketing of agricultural products. ' for the first three years of programming, the rate of financial implementation was fairly satisfactory in terms of commitments, as 42% of total assistance entered in the programmes was committed between 1994 and 1996. however, the level of payments is still quite low: at the end of 1996, payments represented 27% of the assistance provided for in 1994-99. table 1-20: objective 5(a) agriculture

for 1993-96, through the permanent withdrawal of vessels (scrapping, exportation or the creation of joint enterprises). efforts to strengthen the european fisheries and aquaculture industry also continued, especially in the areas of modernisation of the fleet, processing and marketing of products, aquaculture and port facilities. the main developments in 1996 were as follows.24 suspension of fifg aid to the fishing fleet: after the breakdown of negotiations on the 4th multi-annual guidance programme for 1997-2002,25 the commission concluded on 23 december 1996 that from 1 january 1997 arrangements for ftfg contributions to the fleet (aid towards adjusting fishing effort and for the renewal or modernisation of the fleet) should be suspended. such aid represents about 50% of fifg appropriations altogether. the council set a deadline of 30 april 1997.\u00a3or taking a decision. specific measures for conversion of the italian fleet using drifting gillnets (\"spadare\").26 under the conversion plan drawn up for this segment of the fleet by the italian authorities, the commission proposed to the council the adoption of a specific measure to enable aid to be granted to the fishermen and shipowners involved.27 the tide-over allowance for fishermen (granted on condition they undertake to switch to another type of fishing or to a different job outside the industry) may not exceed ecu 918.23 a month per person (with a maximum duration of six months). it may be combined with a severance grant of up to ecu 50 000 for those giving up economic activity altogether, or up to ecu 20 000 for those switching to another job inside or outside the fishing industry. for shipowners, aid between ecu 20 000 and ecu 156 000 is offered for definitive withdrawal from fishing, or between ecu 10 000 and ecu 146 000 for conversion to other types of fishing, depending on the engine power and the year of departure or conversion. 24 for more details, see chapter v. country-by-country survey. 25 this programme defines fishing efforts for each country and each segment of the fleet. the council did not, in the course of 1996 (meetings in october, november and december), reach an agreement on the reduction of effort proposed by the commission (com(96) 203 final of 30 may 1996 and com(96) 237 final of 29 may 1996). 26 these are fishing vessels flying the italian flag and fishing for tuna and swordfish in the mediterranean with drifting gillnets. 27 com(96) 682 final of 16 december 1996. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 47 amendments to the* fifg regulation: regulation (ec) no 3699/93 laying down the criteria and arrangements regarding cornmunity structural assistance in the fisheries and aquaculture sector, amended twice already in 1995, was amended twice more in 1996. the third amendment28 adapted the arrangements for fifg premiums by capping appropriations by country and year for temporary cessation of activity, and by holding constant premiums for permanent withdrawal of vessels over thirty years old. the fourth amendment29 introduced official recognition of origin, with reference to a specified geographical zone for a product or process, under promotion campaigns part-financed by the fifg. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-99 the rate of consumption of appropriations returned to a satisfactory level in 1996, following the difficulties of the previous year, which had been one of preparation for this new financial instrument.30 however, in many cases, actual implementation (expenditure implemented as a percentage of that planned) was well below budget implementation because the budgetary implementation of programmes was faster at the beginning of the period (virtually automatic commitments) than later. this means that the actual implementation off the programmes on the ground has to be monitored carefully. however, programme implementation has made considerable progress in a number of countries thanks to a closer partnership between the corrimission and the national authorities and a greater ability to submit coherent and appropriate projects by those engaged in the industry. table

6.1. the implementation of objective 5(b) in 1996 the main effort in 1996 involved continuing the implementation of the spds approved in earlier years, but in many cases 1996 was the first year of effective and full application of the programmes. the commission also approved some new programmes, the five swedish spds. this brings the total number of spds implementing objective 5(b) to 83. the programmes31 were implemented in the framework of partnership. the various monitoring cornmittees for objective 5(b) ensure that implementation is properly monitored, and that evaluation procedures are organised and carried out. in 1996, the 83 different monitoring committees continued their work on a number of important questions. the first relates to information systems to ensure that the committees are informed of the type of projects actually approved and the financial implications of the commitments and payments made during the year. the second is the organisation of programme assessment, i.e. the preparation of an assessment plan, terms of reference for the contract assessors and monitoring of the actual appointment of assessors.32 the preparation of assessment procedures was a challenge to which most of the monitoring cornmittees rose satisfactorily. the monitoring cornmittees also specified the arrangements for providing technical assistance and the details of the communications programmes. promotion of technological innovation in the areas eligible under objective 5(b): measures identified as being directly linked to technological development in rural areas represent about 1.2% of community appropriations programmed in the spds. within this assistance, the erdf represents 75% of community financing, the esf 15% and the eaggf 10%. measures in favour of rtd represent over two thirds of the technological development and innovation measures financed, a figure comparable to that for the objective 1 programmes. they concentrate on technology transfer, diversification of production and the identification of new markets. a distinctive feature of objective 5(b) programmes is the share of structural fund appropriations spent on data transmission applications, i.e. contributing to the penetration of the information society in rural areas that are often isolated. these measures account for 27% of community appropriations for technological development, the development of new applications such as distance working and distance learning. expenditure in the sector of telecommunications is fairly low (less than 10%) and concerns the improvement of infrastructure in the most isolated areas. \u0142 31 for more details, see chapter v. country-by-country survey. 32 see chapter iv. evaluation. 8th annual report on the structural funds

1995 and the first quarter of 1996. for the total of 83 spds, commitments represented 31% of assistance for the period as a whole. in some member states, the regional authorities succeeded in implementing programme measures quite rapidly, and were able in 1996 to request commitment of the appropriations for 1997. it is clear, however, that some member states are too slow, and will have to make a major effort if they are not to be left behind. this is the more important as the commission does not make payments until the projects have been fully completed, and as at the end of 1996, the level of payments had reached 22% of assistance for 1994-99. with this in view, care should be taken to promote measures enhancing information and advertising to potential beneficiaries. in certain member states, the commission, in agreement with the authorities concerned, paid special attention to the situation of conunitments and payments, in view of the especially difficult progress of the projects. table 1-25: objective 5(b) - implementation in 1994 to 1996 (ecu million) b dk d e f i l nl a fin s ____ total 1994 0,0 6,4 126,0 73,5 262,7 75,5 0,8 18,3 0,0 0.0 0,0 _____ ______

community initiatives 1.1. overview allocation of the reserve and new strands a major event in 1996 was the adoption by the commission on 8 may of a decision allocating the reserve for community initiatives. financial decisions adopted in the two preceding years33 meant that the total reserve available for a supplementary allocation between the member states was ecu 1 665 million (at 1995 prices), comprising ecu 690 million for objective 1 and objective 6 areas, and ecu 975 million for areas not eligible under those objectives. after a series of consultations, the commission endorsed the allocation of the reserve between initiatives and between member states as agreed with.all its institutional partners and in particular in accordance with the code of conduct agreed with parliament. the allocation took into account the following priorities: the fight against unemployment; equal opportunities for men and women; the environment; and the strengthening of the territorial and spatial aspects of the structural policies. it allows industrial conversion initiatives (rechar, r\u00e9sider, retex and konver) and the leader, pesca, urban, adapt and employment initiatives to be strengthened and extended until 1999. the commission also endorsed changes to the guidelines for the urban, adapt and employment initiatives, as well as new guidelines for interreg ii c: \u0142 the guidelines for urban were amended with a view to promoting: equal opportunities; the fight against long-term unemployment; and the urban environment in medium-sized towns; \u0142 the employment and adapt initiatives were each strengthened and supplemented by a new strand: employment - integra (combating social exclusion) and adapt - bis (\"building the information society\") respectively; \u0142 interreg ii c provides for action on three separate fronts, in each case involving general transnational cooperation: development planning; flood prevention and drought control. 33 see 1995 annual

entail an aggregate contribution from the structural funds of ecu 2 380 million, i.e. 17% of the community initiatives total for 1994-99 (including the reserve and the appropriations intended for peace). all the programmes under the following community initiatives have now been adopted: rechar h, retex h, urban, pesca, adapt, employment and regis h. only eleven programmes remain to be approved in respect of 1997: three interreg ii \"a\", two konver, one r\u00e9sider e, one smes and four leader. 34ojnoc200, 10.7.1996. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 53 table 1-27: community

programmes adopted in 1993 and amended since 1994 ' including one nrocramme adopted in respect of the reserve ' includinc 98 proiirammes. three national networks adopted in 1996 and the community network including the national networks the initiatives must have a demonstration value and give rise to exchanges of experience that are likely to enhance the usefulness of the innovative operations and sound practice featured in the programmes, the aim being to include the subjects concerned in a csf or an spd. since almost every programme has now been approved by the cornmission, implementation cannot be limited to individual projects selected by member states or regions. the programmes must be seen in a wider national or regional context than that of their implementation, particularly in the case of the least developed regions, where the demand for the transfer of know-how is strongest. it is for this reason that the commission has decided to implement a number of trans-national measures. accordingly, in order to enhance the usefulness of the measures implemented in the context of the four industrial conversion initiatives (r\u00e9sider h, rechar h, retex ii and konver), the cornmission has decided to launch various operations aimed at exchanging experience and sound practice. similarly, in connection with the smes initiative, the commission opted, in the context of its 1994 decisitjh on the initial allocation of appropriations, to earmark ecu 25 million for trans-national operations. this allowed the following three operations to be launched at the end of 1996: a call for proposals for the creation, at european level, of an internet network for smes operating in the field of tourism in objective 1, 2, 5(b) and 6 regions;35 financial support for the holding of purchaser exhibitions (ibex) for smes in objective 1, 2, 5(b) and 6 regions;36 exchanges of experience specific to smes by way of awareness, information and communication measures aimed at identifying \"sound practice\". trans-national cooperation, exchanges of experience and the transfer of know-how constitute one of the new fields of the leader initiative, which is bolstered by a network (the european observatory of rural innovation and development), one of whose tasks is to provide technical assistance in the context of trans-national cooperation. an indicative amount of 2.5% of the total financing for leader is intended to fund the activities of the community network and the national networks. in 1996 the body selected by the commission to organise and run leader's european observatory proceeded with its work: publications, seminars, exchanges of experience and setting-up of a multilingual information system on the internet. trans-national measures were also launched in the context of pesca in 1996, in the shape of invitations to tender and calls for proposals. the three calls for tenders issued concerned: the dissemination of an information bulletin; the organisation of inter-regional meetings and thematic conferences; and the organisation of two partnership meetings, scheduled for 1997 and 1999, between 35 see 1.2 below: presentation of each initiative in turn - the smes initiative. 36 see chapter ii.d.6. structural funds and smes. 54 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) firms belonging to the industry. the call for proposals was aimed at the part-financing of transnational cooperation and networking projects in the field of training, retraining, economic diversification, local development, etc. a total of seven projects received community support in the context of that call for proposals. in the case of adapt and employment, the trans-national technical assistance programme launched in 1995 to help the commission and the member states implement the two initiatives continued to operate in 1996. the support frameworks at national and at european level (europs) served to coordinate the setting-up of trans-national partnership projects throughout the union, underpin the execution of projects and collate the first structured data on the work carried out. community initiatives and development of technological potential: many community initiatives underpin technological development in the process of attaining their principal objectives. in the case of the most representative community initiatives, under the smes initiative, promoting competitiveness among firms and job creation is achieved through the development of new information and telecommunications technologies, rtd networks and innovation. the interreg programmes are aimed at alleviating the adverse effects of cross-border location by extending cross-border cooperation to research and the new technologies. technological development also plays a major role in the diversification of economic activities and the strengthening of the regional capacities that are the subject of the industrial conversion initiatives. in terms of human resources, the new technologies are one of the principal fields in which close cooperation is developing between training centres and the public and private sectors in the context of adapt and, in the case of employment, they facilitate the development of reliable databases and the integration into the labour market of the unemployed, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups. for their part, the leader programmes highlight the importance of data transmission in rural development, in particular in providing support for local production centres. 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-97/99 all the institutional partners have recorded delays in the approval of certain programmes, delays which are due to the very nature of the community initiatives which, in relation to the csfs and spds, have certain special features that make them specific instruments of the union's structural policy: implementation from the bottom up; a high profile in the field in the context of a broad-based partnership; innovative approach (in certain cases); and trans-national, cross-border and inter-regional cooperation. it is not always easy to incorporate these special features at the prograrnming stage. the requirement of a broad-based partnership, for instance, represents a major challenge. it may be the first experience some of the socio-economic actors involved in a programme have had of this working method. these multiple partnerships feature numerous levels of intervention which are sometimes difficult to manage. moreover, in order to give community initiatives a true trans-national, cross-border or inter-regional dimension, pride of place is given to trans-national cooperation between projects. this is a new and complex process on this scale. innovative action and measures featuring strict selection criteria at regional and national level often call for lengthy analysis at member state level. the commission is, however, keen to endorse quality programmes satisfying those requirements. on the whole, with the industrial conversion initiatives, it has more often than not been a question of consolidating existing experience. for other initiatives approaching new issues, further negotiations with the member states on the content of the programmes proved necessary. this was the case for instance of the smes initiative, the programmes for which gave rise to numerous adjustments, in particular concerning the innovative and internationalisation aspects of smes. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 55 table 1-28: community

entered into since 1994 have been implemented. the overwhelming majority of the programmes totalling less than ecu 40 million were the subject of a single commitment when the programmes were approved. the total annual commitment mirrors the rate of approval of the programmes. the four industrial conversion initiatives and pesca recorded the highest percentage of commitments, this being attributable to the fact that the programmes under those initiatives are mostly below the ecu 40 million level and are under regional management. since most of the programmes were approved at the end of 1995 or, in some cases, in 1996 they are at the start-up phase. this explains why the level of payments (about 22% of all structural fund assistance for community initiatives generally) is in some cases low. the bulk of the implementation and monitoring of the programmes is expected to take place in 1997. 56 . . . \u0142 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 12. the individual initiatives adapt (1994-99) adapt (ecu 1 638 million37) is aimed at encouraging the adaptation of the workforce to industrial change, helping firms increase their productivity, and fostering the emergence of new activities. the measures concerned cover: training, counselling and guidance, anticipation and promotion of new employment opportunities, adaptation of support structures and systems, information, dissemination and greater awareness. ilie main beneficiaries are workers affected by industrial change. adapt and the anticipation of technological change: the initial adapt guidelines provided for encouragement for cooperation and exchanges between enterprises and research centres with a view to assisting the transfer of technology, and for studies focusing on the introduction of new production processes and systems and the use of communication and information systems. in the programmes that have been adopted, measures relating to telecommunications and the information society are provided for by a number of member states, namely italy, greece, portugal, france, ireland, finland and the united kingdom. in particular, the programme for france earmarks 4% of the overall budget for training in the new technologies and the use of flexible systems and distance learning, while under the programme for portugal 10% of the overall budget is to be allocated to data transmission applications and 20% to rtd in measures to introduce new technologies and encourage the setting-up of information networks. in 1996 a new strand was added to adapt: adapt-bis (building the information society), which will encourage programmes to take into account the emergence of the information society and its consequences as far as the competitiveness and the way in which european firms operate are concerned. in particular, adapt-bis is aimed at encouraging: \u0142 the identification and transfer of sound practices as regards the use of new information and communications technologies that are suited to local development conditions, requirements and levels; \u0142 large-scale experimentation and. dissemination of the findings in europe, to include the results already obtained thanks to community rtd and vocational training programmes. a significant feature of the implementation of adapt in 1996 was the build-up of projects selected following the first call for projects in 1995. some 1 400 projects were launched or, as was mostly the case, were-implemented for their first full year. calls for tenders for the evaluations in the member states were also issued in 1996. a first series of interim reports was expected to be submitted to the monitoring committees by the end of march 1997 at the latest. this first series of projects - now being implemented - has already revealed concerns and interests that are common to the various member states and regions. many relate to at least one of the principal themes of the initiative: development of, and support for, smes; nature and impact of changes in the way work is organised; anticipation of labour market trends; qualifications; effectiveness of local labour markets; job creation; and the impact of the information society. the projects are supported and organised by labour market agencies generally: enterprises (in particular smes), groups of firms, sectoral organisations, chambers of commerce, craft industries and agriculture, trade unions and other workers' organisations, public and private training agencies and universities, local and regional authorities, local development agencies and ngos. this increased level of activity has had an impact on the commission's level of financial implementation in 1996. total commitments rose from ecu 307.7 million to ecu 530.1 million and payments as a whole went up from ecu 152.6 million to ecu 239.6 million. 37 at 1996 prices, including the reserve. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 57 table 1-30: adapt - 1996 in the context of

resources (ecu 1 849 million38): the aim is to use an integrated approach to underpin the recover)' of employment and promote solidarity and equal opportunities on the labour market. a total of four strands - each with its own budget - are currently covered: \u0142 now (ecu 496 million) supports innovative approaches to vocational training for women; \u0142 horizon (ecu 513 million) encourages the disabled and other disadvantaged groups to enter working life; \u0142 youthstart (ecu 441 million) helps young people without qualifications enter working life; \u0142 integra (ecu 385 million), a new strand adopted in 1996, is aimed at making access to the labour market easier for vulnerable groups that are excluded or at risk of being excluded from it. this strand now covers horizon measures in favour of disadvantaged persons. employment and adaptation to the new technologies : thanks to each strand of employment, measures can be funded that encourage new information and communications technologies (now : training in new skills in the field of rtd and innovative technology; horizon : adaptation of the workplace through the development of new technologies and distance working and flexible training and learning, such as distance learning and learning by computer; youthstart : giving young people access to the labour market through distance learning). the new technologies constitute a major avenue towards possible improvements in the employment prospects of the employment initiative target groups: firstly they afford interesting possibilities of innovation in terms of training methodology, be it in the case of distance learning or of training assisted by modern means of information technology; secondly introducing new technologies changes working methods and, in some cases, contributes to creating new jobs or occupations. accordingly, to take account of that impact and give a greater share of the working population access to those new jobs, the training needs to be adapted in terms both of content and methods. for example some 7% of the projects covered by youthstart focus on activities relating to jobs arising from new information technologies, and one fifth of the horizon projects explore the ways in which new technologies can help the disabled secure employment. as in the case of adapt, a significant feature of the implementation of employment in 1996 was the strong showing of projects selected at the time of the first call for projects in 1995. some 2 400 were launched or, in the majority of cases, completed their first full year of implementation. activities focusing on training - which have always constituted a major component of this type of programme -are increasingly integrated in more general measures based on cooperation between local actors and aimed at providing the target groups with integrated solutions in terms of access to the labour market 38 at 1996 prices, including the reserve. 58 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) or training systems. notable also are the search for new jobs and the desire to encourage the creation of new firms (in particular under now), above all in what are regarded as promising sectors. generally speaking, training centres remain major players, although there is also a strong showing by local and regional authorities, in particular in southern europe, and by ngos and associations. on the other hand, the two sides of industry do not appear to be playing a sufficiently prominent role in the implementation of the projects. the commission would like to see greater activity on their part in the second phase of the initiative, the aim being to forge a link between the projects and the concerns felt by economic operators. the impact of this increased level of activity on financial execution in 1996 is significant. commitments went up from ecu 236 million to ecu 572 million and payments from ecu 117.8 million to ecu 324.6 million. table 1-31: employment -

million39) supports rural development projects devised and managed by local partners in which the emphasis is on measures that are innovative, have a demonstration value and are transferable. the projects have to be based on development strategies that are consistent and adapted to the areas concerned. assistance from leader ii is available only to local action groups (public and private partners jointly devising a development strategy) or other rural collective bodies (local authorities, chambers of agriculture, commerce and industry, cooperatives, etc.), provided their operations fit in with a development strategy at local level. leader ii applies to rural areas covered by objectives 1, 5(b) and 6 (with ecu 1 086 million earmarked for objective 1 and objective 6 regions). leader and technological innovation in rural areas: through its \"rural innovation programme\" strand, leader encourages innovation - adapted in the light of the local context - in terms of methods, products, processes and markets and the demonstrability and transferability of projects. it accordingly fosters local development initiatives aimed at achieving new dynamism. the operations receiving assistance are varied and may concern: measures that supplement those relating to agricultural markets (including the environmental aspects and renewable sources of energy); the application of new information and communication technologies to the rural environment; or the design and marketing of new products and services. among the measures eligible are those for rural tourism (innovative investment and the introduction of booking systems based on information technology); smes (measures to improve access to technology transfer services and the development of distance working, the aim being to at 1996 prices, including the reserve. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 59 obtain the best return from agricultural products or promote the transfer of technology, telemarketing and alternative and renewable sources of energy); and the environment (waste recycling). quantifying the funds made available for technological development is no mean task. the appropriations for technological innovation are, however, allocated to the use of information technology applications, seen as a means of reducing the isolation of rural areas. these operations concern distance working, communication centres and the development of telecommunications for firms. while few resources are allocated to rtd as such, applied research projects are aimed mostly at obtaining the best return from local produce. examples of innovative applied research projects: \u0142 the arca umbria area (perugia), which specialises in ceramics - an industry facing a pollution/waste problem - had developed a waste-recycling process that was in need of experimentation. leader made it possible for the experimentation phase to begin and for the system - which can be applied to the management of other pollutants - to be developed. \u0142 the sierra de bejar francia group (salamanca), which is situated in an olive-growing area threatened by low farm incomes, has, thanks to a study financed by leader, developed a new process for the treatment of olive oil waste. the process allows the waste to be transformed into reusable by-products, thus alleviating a major environmental problem. \u0142 the creuse programme (limousin) is aimed at updating traditional know-how by creating new products, encouraging apprenticeships; and promoting products commercially. a prototype workshop designs new productsbased on local know-how, in particular in the field of screen printing and furnishing fabrics. \u0142 atanogia (crete), the leader group has, thanks to the programme, been able to build premises and equip the centre for the diagnosis and control of zoonoses, infectious animal diseases that are transmissible to man. the research centre is operating in collaboration with the university of crete and the anogia health centre and is recognised by who as a collaborating centre for research and training for mediterranean areas affected by zoonoses. since 1994 the cominission has received from the fifteen member states 102 proposals for programmes (not including technical assistance programmes) under leader. it has seen to it that, in accordance with leader .ii guidelines, the proposais are the outcome of broad-based concertation between local actors. following on from the 67 programmes and global grants it adopted in 1995, the commission adopted 34 programmes in 1996 - 31 regional programmes (11 of which concern the new member states) and three technical assistance programmes (implementing national networks). the new programmes represent a total of ecu 253.4 million in structural fund assistance and account for 14% of the total budget for leader (including the reserve). only the belgian programmes and the balance of the technical

skills of fishermen, or obtaining the best return from fisheries products and improving distribution channels. pesca applies mainly in areas dependent on fisheries situated in objective 1, 2, 5(b) and 6 areas, with half the funding being earmarked for objective 1 and objective 6 regions. in the wake of the difficulties that affected its launch in 1995 (late adoption of the programmes, complex nature of the management machinery, etc.), the pesca initiative had a slow but steady start. while several projects were already being implemented in germany, denmark, spain, ireland and the united kingdom, a number of major difficulties remained to be resolved in france, italy and the netherlands. other significant events in 1996 were the adoption of the pesca programmes for sweden and finland

will be spent. technological innovation at the heart of the smes initiative: this is the principal community initiative that fosters technological development in small firms. under the programmes, more than 15% of the structural funds appropriations are allocated to research and development, to telecommunications services and to data transmission applications, the latter being the subject of close attention. it should be recalled that the smes initiative is a continuation of the stride (strengthening technological potential in less-favoured regions), prisma (improved services for firms) and t\u00e9l\u00e9matique (using advanced telecommunications services) initiatives, some of the current programmes being based on the experience gained and the progress achieved in the context of those initiatives. measures eligible for support cover, on the one hand, improvements in production and organisation systems in small firms through non-tangible investments (technological innovation and advanced communication and information systems) and, on the other, cooperation between research centres and smes, the aim being to match regional research activities and local needs and thus better satisfy sme requirements in terms of technological transfer and applications. under the programmes, adapting to the new information and communication technologies and applications thereof within firms qualifies for about 40% of the community appropriations intended for technological innovation. the measures concern in particular improved access for smes to data transmission services and networks and distance working. as regards measures to encourage rtd, which attract over a third of the appropriations for technological innovation, there are significant differences as between programmes with none provided for under the greek programmes whereas they constitute a major component of other programmes (e.g. 47%> both for the united kingdom and for the netherlands). such measures include support for innovation, technological transfer and cooperation between smes and research and technology transfer centres). . 42 at 1996 prices, including the reserve. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 63 tourism smes on the internet: encouraging smes operating in the tourist industry to advertise and trade via the internet is one of the three trans-national measures launched by the commission in 1996.43 it is aimed at helping tourism smes to be present on worldwide multimedia networks, and thereby enable them to benefit from electronic advertising and commercial activities. in an industry such as that of tourism, in which the emphasis is increasingly on large-scale markets and on highly integrated supply, it is very difficult for smes to fund marketing strategies on a pan-european scale, hence the need for coordination at local, regional and community level. the aim is accordingly: \u0142 to create, at european level, a coordination structure that will constitute a common internet access point for tourism smes; \u0142 to set up a system of regional or local agents responsible for concentrating and managing the provision, via the internet, of services to tourism smes and for creating an interface between potential clients and local smes. the commission has received more than 180 proposals for projects relating to agents whose task would be to coordinate the regional or local initiatives. selection was expected to take place in the first half of 1997, the programmes themselves being launched before the end of that year. in relation to the 36 programmes planned overall, a total of 14 new programmes were adopted in 1996, accounting for ecu 511.8 million in assistance from the structural funds, i.e. about 47% of the total (ecu 1 087 million including the reserve and ecu 1 062 million without it). since 21 programmes were adopted in 1995, there remained only one smes initiative programme to be adopted (that for the

are fairly low figures compared with other initiatives. of the fourteen programmes adopted in 1996, two are financially sizeable programmes under national management (spain and italy). since these are community initiative programmes of upwards of ecu 40 million, the commitments concern the 1996 instalment only. the twelve other programmes, covering smaller amounts, were the subject of a single

closer ties between the most remote regions and the rest of the community include in particular the upgrading of telecommunications infrastructure and training in the new technologies. they represent 5.5% of structural fund appropriations for regis programmes. measures in the field of rtd - in particular support for the transfer of know-how - make up the bulk of the appropriations earmarked for technological development. access to advanced telecommunications and data transmission services also accounts for a major share, the aim being to bring the regions concerned closer to the sources of information and thus reduce their isolation. in 1996 three new programmes for france were adopted which together attracted a contribution of ecu 150.5 million from the structural funds, i.e. about 25% of the total of ecu 612 million earmarked for regis. following the adoption of three other programmes in 1995, all the programmes under regis have now been approved. table 1-38: regis - programmes

industrial conversion initiatives (rechar, r\u00e9sider and konver) and technological innovation: the industrial conversion initiative guidelines attach a great deal of importance to adapting to the

gathering of information on innovative products and processes; and, in particular in the case of konver, the dissemination of innovative methods of production and new systems of business organisation. it is difficult, however, to draw up a detailed list of the measures and, therefore, of the appropriations specifically allocated to those measures under the various programmes since they are more often than not part of larger industrial conversion measures. rechar (1994-99) rechar (ecu 462 million43) supports conversion in the areas worst affected by the decline of the coal industry, with priority being given to environmental protection, to the rehabilitation of former mining buildings, to new economic activities (in particular for smes) and to training and employment. in relation to the planned overall total of 30 programmes, four new programmes were adopted in 1996 which together accounted for a structural funds contribution of ecu 83.2 million, i.e. 18% of the ecu 462 million

of former industrial land, encourage the setting up of schemes to restructure sites for multi-purpose uses and enhance the value of the industrial heritage. part-financed operations will have to be fully integrated into the development strategy of the areas concerned and give due importance to quality. priority is in particular given to the three sites steeped in the region's mining history (pit 11/19 at loos-en-45 at 1996 prices, including the reserve. 66 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) gohelle, pit 9/9a at oignies and the aremberg pit at wallers), the aim being to link up in a network with the mining centre of lewarde. the heritage and historical value of the three sites is officially recognised and there is, by virtue of the location (proximity to the mining belt, the future dourges hub and the state forest), genuine potential for development. the 1996 commitments correspond to 29% of the structural funds assistance for programmes approved since 1994. with the exception of some programmes adopted in 1995 (rhineland-westphalia, east midlands and yorkshire), rechar programmes fell under the ecu 40 million mark and, when they were adopted, ^were the subject of a single commitment. accordingly, the 1996 commitments largely concern programmes adopted in 1996. the 1996 payments also relate above all to programmes adopted in 1996. aggregate payments in 1994-96 represent 33% of the assistance from the structural funds for programmes adopted during that period. since this is an initiative which was initially scheduled for 1994-97, the level of payments in 1994-96 suggests that some ci programmes might, with the benefit of the flexibility afforded in the context of the allocation of the reserve, be extended until 1999. table 1-41: rechar - 1996 in the

steelworking at caen has made it imperative to define a strategy for converting the employment area (industrial and port activities, training and land use). the central concern is to define a new economic activity, the aim being firstly to establish a link with the conurbation, by including the' converted site in the local public transport network and by involving local smes in the work, and secondly to set up, with the help of firms, a prospecting and engineering method that can lead to the creation of a sizeable agri-foodstuffs site at caen. several stages are planned: \u0142 surveys covering potential major international investors and smes within the industry, the aim being to identify the most dynamic sectors and investors' actual expectations; \u0142 development of the area: clean factories, technological and display area; reception area for firms from other sectors (biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics) and joint services. most of the community assistance has been committed, except for the three biggest programmes in financial terms (rhineland-westphalia, italy and spain), for which only the first instalment has been committed. the 1996 commitments accordingly

technology centre planned and built in partnership with local firms in one of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods (\"la bourgogne\")- it will each year provide technical training for fifty young people up to cap (certificat d'aptitude professionnelle) level. in the context of this project there will be a general neighbourhood educational project, the aim being to address the shortage of skills and the exclusion of young people. as well as being innovative and partnership-based, it will be in keeping with the strategy of redevelopment and monitoring of industrial changes in the area (objective 2). in italy the cities of syracuse and bari are each planning to revitalise their historical centre (\"isola d'onigia\" and \"borgo antico\" respectively). poverty and a diminishing population will in both cases be addressed, firstly by the development of new tourism-related activities and targeted training for residents, and secondly by improving living conditions and controlling urban delinquency. in finland the city of joensuu (northern karelia, covered by objective 6) is facing the country's worst unemployment problem. much of its population, exeluded from the employment market, lives in the \"rantakyl\u00e0-utra\" neighbourhood, a municipal housing area where alcohol, drugs and the break-up of families are major problems. the urban programme will take action in the area by introducing measures to encourage employment and businesses, improve living conditions and promote training. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 71 the large number of programmes adopted in 1996 accounts for the year's good showing (58% and 65% respectively) in terms of commitments and payments for the period 1994-96. by the end of 1996 about 55% of the assistance from the structural funds for the initiative had been committed and about 24% had been paid. the level of payments (less than half that of commitments) shows that most of the programmes are still at the start-up phase. table 1-49: urban - 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-97 (ecu million) member state (number of programmes) belgium (3) denmark ( 1 ) germany (10) greece (1)

objective 1 areas); regen (ecu 500 million at 1994 prices), i.e. the completion of energy networks to link them up to wider european networks; and the new interreg ii c (ecu 412.8 million at 1996 prices), i.e. cooperation in the field of development planning. interreg iia and the technological development of border areas: in the interreg ii a guidelines, the commission invited the member states to increase inter-regional cooperation in the field of research, technology and telecommunications. this applies in particular to aid for smes, for which cross-border technological transfer and cross-border networks of smes can be developed. it applies also to areas with a shortfall in terms of amenities, where improving the systems of telecommunications can serve to supplement the trans-european networks. similarly, interreg encourages cooperation in the field of education and culture, including cooperation between research centres in border areas. although the programmes generally earmark 2.5% of the structural funds appropriations for this type of investment, the situation varies between member states. the netherlands, spain, greece and ireland place the emphasis on telecommunications, in the shape of measures to develop cross-border networks and services (fibre optic links, advanced telecommunications centres, promotion of data transmission activities, and information networks). other member states with joint programmes focus on rtd: france, belgium and the netherlands, which provide for measures aimed at technological transfer, cooperation in the field of research and training in new technology. example - technical cooperation between france and belgium: the wallonidnord/pas-de-calais/picardy programme, which was adopted in 1996, is aimed at supporting technological innovation among smes. two cross-border multidisciplinaiy teams have been created, one to conduct a technology watch and the other dealing direct with enterprises with a view to providing technical assistance and a technological transfer service. the teams ' tasks are as follows: \u0142 to provide direct technical assistance in the form of product-testing, identifying raw materials and solving technical problems or technological advice; ^ 50 at 1996 prices, including the reserve. 72 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) making available to firms a test

for the workers concerned. in the case of the cross-bord\u00e9e cooperation and regen strands, out of a total of 62 programmes presented by the member states for 1994-99, 25 were adopted in 1996, for a total of ecu 701.9 million in assistance from the structural funds, i.e. about 23% of the total of ecu 3 063 million (not including the reserve). altogether, three interreg ii cross-border cooperation programmes remain to be adopted (italy/slovenia, italy/austria and italy/greece), since 34 were adopted in 1996. table 1-50: interreg ii - programmes adopted in 1996 (ecu million) total

trans-national cooperation in the field of development planning. its purpose is to contribute to more evenly balanced land development in europe by seeking a better spatial allocation of activities and the correction of disparities as part of a strategy of sustainable development. interreg ii c is also aimed at improving the impact of community policies on land development and at encouraging, in the context of land development priorities that are common to adjoining geographical areas, trans-national cooperation between member states and the authorities responsible for land development. interreg ii c is also expected to help member states and their regions adopt a preventative and cooperative approach to water-management problems caused by drought and floods. it covers three main themes: general trans-national cooperation, flood prevention and drought control. the programmes are of a transnational nature and tend to concern at least three countries, of which at least two must be member states, except for drought control, which can concern a single member state, and flood prevention, where bilateral programmes are allowed. at the end of 1996 the member states let it be known that they intended to develop jointly 14 operational programmes, which were expected to be proposed and approved in 1997. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) table 1-51: interreg

of the programmes adopted in the course of the year since they also cover the second instalment of programmes adopted in earlier years. payments amount to 23% of the assistance from the community, showing that the programmes are mostly still at the start-up phase. table 1-52: interreg ii - 1996 in the context of programming for 1994-97 (ecu million) (number of programmes) total (59) assistance*

million51): the programme for peace and reconciliation in northern ireland is aimed at supporting the construction of a more peaceful and stable society by providing the resources needed to maintain the local social and economic fabric. the objective is to promote the social integration of people on the margins of economic and social life, to restore economic growth and encourage social renewal in the areas that have suffered most from the conflict. in 1996 the programme became fully operational. one of its features is that, where possible, the process of decision-making and implementation involve the persons concerned. implementation itself is built around eight non-governmental bodies (groups and cooperatives, including one cross-border structure) and 26 district partnerships (bringing together representatives from political, economic and trade union circles, industrial promotion associations and private initiatives), which is why setting up the programme proved time-consuming. the first awards of aid by the non-governmental bodies were announced in march 1996 and, by june, all were in a position to fund projects. the 26 district 51 at 1996 prices. 74 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) partnerships were approved and issued calls for local projects to be included in the action plans, the first part-financing of which was adopted at the end of the year. decentralised structures are currently responsible for 57% of the funding provided for in the programme. standard activities include aid for industrial promotion associations and private schemes, which often operate in collaboration with victims of violence and with women, young people, ex-prisoners and the long-term unemployed. the emphasis is on access to the employment market, in particular by providing resources for those who are excluded from it and by helping them take part in decision-making. support for local potential is a key component, especially at district partnership level, and includes measures aimed at urban and rural renewal and the revitalisation of the physical, economic or social environment. the granting of interest rate subsidies in respect of investment loans and related services, in particular for smes and tourism, is another activity that has proved very successful. events in 1996 suggest that achieving lasting peace may well be a slow process. by putting the emphasis on consensus, on a joint approach aimed at achieving concrete results and on forward planning, however, the programme is a constructive component able to underpin initiatives at various levels. introduced for the first time in a structural funds programme, the consultative forum - an instrument within which representatives of all sectors and allegiances are responsible for the management of the programme - highlights these indispensable principles of participation, cooperation and concrete action in a new european context. table 1-53: peace - 1996 in the

the erdf regulation innovative measures under article 10 of the erdf regulation the commission has, for 1995-99, defined four priorities - each with a multiannual budget -implemented by pilot projects selected following a call for proposals. following the definition of the priorities in 1994,52 and the issuing of the calls for proposals in 1995,53 the process of selection took place in 1996, with the help of independent panels of experts, and innovative measures funded under article 10 of the erdf regulation were launched in the field. it is worth underlining the success of the calls for proposals for the various innovative action programmes: for external inter-regional cooperation, the new sources of employment and cultural cooperation programmes, for instance, the commission received a total of 865 proposals for projects (the actual figures were 243, 357 and 265 respectively) but, because of the overall budget and the amounts earmarked for each project, it was able to select only 123 (50, 41 and 32 respectively). similarly, 142 and 503 proposals have been received for development planning projects and urban pilot projects, of which 14 and 25 respectively may well be selected (in 1997). 52 see 1994 annual report. 53 see 1995 annual report. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 75 table 1-54: innovative measures (article 10 of the erdf regulation) -

training sessions and meetings with the programme's managers. mid-term review days to be held in 1997 will provide an opportunity for project leaders to present the results. recite internal inter-regional cooperation programme: 1996 saw the closure of the recite i programme and the launch of recite h an evaluation report on recite i was drawn up in january 1996 by the programme's technical assistance office. a total of thirteen* projects were completed and brought to a close, leaving a further 23 to be closed*. recite i facilitated the creation of 36 cooperation networks, in which a total of 405 partners, regional and local municipalities, development agencies, chambers of commerce and private partners took part. some of the partners were involved in more than one network. the work consisted of joint measures and transfers of expertise via technical workshops and working parties, exchanges of staff, technical fact-finding missions and public conferences. concomitantly with these exchange activities, some projects developed training activities for staff participating in the networks and for those involved in regional development. numerous theme-based studies have been carried out, supplemented by comparative studies that have enriched the mutual understanding between partners from different regions. exchanges of expertise have helped to forge closer links and develop common approaches, develop and put into practice new information and communication technologies and test evaluation methodologies. the significant features of the launch of recite ii are the publication of the terms of the call for proposals and the setting-up of a technical assistance bureau. the call for proposals, which was published in the official journal on 31 october 1996 with 15 may 1997 as the closing date, selected five fields for cooperation: developing specific local potential, particularly for the creation of permanent jobs; improving access to the european market for smes through appropriate techniques for cooperation between firms; improving the supply to smes of services that encourage them to innovate; establishing and developing resource centres to enhance the value of work and improve the integration of women into economic life; preserving and improving the environment, in particular by promoting renewable sources of energy and energy saving and introducing - in particularly vulnerable areas - new methods and techniques to prevent the degradation of the environment. community part-financing per project (one third of the partners in which must be from areas eligible under objectives 1 and/or 6) will be between ecu 1 and 3 million. 76 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) ecos-ouverture external inter-regional cooperation programme: in 1996 the programme entered a new phase, with an increase in the overall budget and coverage extending for the first time to cities and regions in non-member mediterranean countries. a call for proposals was issued at the end of 1995 with 1 april 1996 as the closing date. a total of 243 proposals were submitted in response to that notice, a considerable increase on the 160 submitted in november 1994. of the 243 proposals, fifty were selected for funding by the erdf and phare. they cover an eighteen-month period and some were launched as early as the autumn of 1996. innovative regional development measures new sources of employment: in the white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, the commission identified the sectors of activity with the greatest potential for employment, and the main obstacles to the development of that employment. it is in that context that measures under article 10 are aimed, on the one hand, at promoting regional or local strategies in terms of new fields of employment and, on the other, at testing the creation of proximity jobs by promoting pilot projects. this applies to a number of priority areas, namely services to people (children, the aged, etc.), living conditions (renovation and modernisation of housing, collective transport, proximity shops in rural areas, etc.) and the environment (recycling, nature reserves, the control of pollution, etc.). the pilot projects are implemented for 24 months and are based on a wide-ranging partnership between local authorities and the private sector in areas with a population of at least 200 000. by the time of its closing date (3.1 january 1996) the call for proposals, which was issued in september 1995, had attracted 357 projects, mainly from spain (97), italy (82) and france (47). after evaluating them the commission selected a total of 41 projects.54 table 1-55: pilot projects - new sources of employment - breakdown of projects

ecu 15.2 million) towards an average total budget of ecu 823 000. a launch seminar was held at oberhausen in november 1996 in collaboration with the land of north rhine-westphalia. this enabled the representatives of the 41 projects to engage in an exchange of views and experience, to receive expert advice in terms of management and monitoring and for the seeds of network cooperation based on topics of common interest to be sown. cultural inter-regional cooperation: in response to the call for proposals published in september 1995, the commission received 265 proposals for pilot projects on inter-regional cultural cooperation, of which it selected 32. the aim of the pilot projects is to enhance the value of the regional and local cultural heritage and to establish cultural networks between eu regions and cities. a total of ecu 15 million has been earmarked for these measures, with part-financing limited to ecu 600 000 per project. implementation of the projects was expected to begin on 1 january 1997 and last two years. cooperation could cover in particular the enhancement of the value of the historical, architectural, industrial and craft-industry heritage. the projects selected concern mainly the enhancement of the 54 for projects adopted, see chapter x - pilot projects under article 10 of the erdf regulation. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996), 77

the value of the maritime heritage integrated development of spa towns technological innovation and the information society in erdf innovative measures: promoting technological innovation, underpinning technology transfer and helping the regions adapt to the information society are the major themes of the measures financed under article 10 of the erdf regulation. the measures are based on a coordination of the commission's measures in favour of innovation (action plan for innovation). in particular, community action is aimed, on the one hand, at providing firms with appropriate technology and making them aware of the advantages of innovation and, on the other, at promoting an environment that lends itself to the use of technology by firms, thanks to': \u0142 better understanding of the process of innovation, the dissemination of best practice and the exchange of experience; \u0142 an improvement in the professional capabilities of the intermediaries providing support for innovation; \u0142 a greater ability on the part of businesses and/or research centres to make the best possible use of innovative techniques and processes; \u0142 a financial environment that encourages innovation. innovative measures funded under article 10 of the erdf regulation are in keeping with this approach, which is based on closer cooperation between the public and the private sector and on cooperation between regional firms and the regional infrastructure offering or services related to technological innovation and the information society. they consist of social engineering measures aimed at bringing about socio-economic and institutional conditions that lend themselves to the development of technological innovation and the information society. the thinking behind these measures can be summed up as \"cooperating (and thus innovating) at local level in order to become competitive at global level\". such cooperation is seen as a key factor in the establishment of a innovative regional environment. innovative measures and promoting innovation: a total of ecu 15 million is earmarked for funding regional innovation strategies in 1995-99. implementation is in two parts, the first being an experimental phase covering 1994-96. in both cases two types of measure have been selected: innovation strategies and technology transfer projects. the period i994-9655 saw the implementation of eight regional technological plans (four in objective 2 areas and four in objective 1 regions56) and three technology transfer projects.57 \u0142 example - the regional technology plan for wales: is aimed at making businesses more competitive by way of an action plan drawn up in the light of two years' consultations with nearly 600 regional firms and organisations. it provides for more than sixty projects and measures, of which forty are expected to be launched in 1996. \u0142 example \u0142 the implace project: this is a technology transfer project coordinated by the castile-la mancha and northern ireland regions, both of which are eligible under objective i. it is aimed at encouraging the use of advanced information and communication technology by manufacturing smes in less-favoured regions. 55 see 1995 annual report. 56 saxony, wales, lorraine and limburg (objective 2) and castile-le\u00f4n, central macedonia, abruzzi and none (objective 1) respectively. 57 coordinated by extremadura, apulia, castile-la mancha and northern ireland respectively. 7$ 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) for 1995-99 a total of 19 ris (regional innovation strategies) and seven rtt (regional transfer of technology) projects have been selected following a call for tenders. the commission formally adopted 12 ris in 199658. regional innovation strategies are aimed at promoting, within the traditional productive tissue, the various expressions of innovation: technological innovation and research, plus economic and institutional innovation. innovative measures and promotion of the information society: innovative measures for the information society also feature two project phases (1994-96 and 1995-99) and two types of measures (drawing up regional strategies and developing data transmission applications). a total of ecu 20 million (ecu 15 million from the erdf and ecu 5 million from the esf) is earmarked for 1995-99. the period 1994-96 saw the launch of six irisi pilot schemes and one multiregional data transmission application project involving seven regions: . \u00ab \u0142 irisi projects: in each of the regions,59 a broad-based partnership has been forged between local and regional institutions and representatives of the world of business, training, education, trade unions, chambers of commerce and the cooperative movement with a view to devising a regional strategy for the development of the information society. the project is aimed at developing, and facilitating access to, various fields: distance working, distance learning, university/research networks, data transmission services for smes, the use of data transmission for health-care purposes, etc. \u0142 the wolf project (world wide web opportunities for less-favoured regions): seven regions are working together to identify social, economic and technical factors that stand in the way of the deployment of telecommunications services in less-favoured regions. the project supports the development of about 100 smes from these regions through the use of the internet and related services. for 1995-99, a total of 22 pilot projects introducing risis (regional information society initiatives) and nine risi 2 regional data transmission application projects are planned. altogether 15 ris1 projects were adopted in 199660: \u0142 the risi (14 funded by the erdf and eight by the esf) are aimed at identifying the economic opportunities and risks inherent in the information society so as to anticipate their effects. the focus will be on forging a regional consensus as to how to integrate the information society-concept within regional development. each region draws up a strategy and action plan approved by local operators and featuring, in the case of the strategy, an analysis of the current situation with regard to human resources and employment and scenarios for the integration of new services and, in the case of the action plan, a feasibility study on the applications considered. \u0142 the risi 2 (seven funded by the erdf and two by the esf) are aimed at demonstrating the best practices as far as regional responses to the information society are concerned. several municipalities will work together to prepare and launch data transmission applications, with priority being given to applications involving at least three regions, each of which must belong to a different member state, and one third of the regions at least must qualify under objective 1. major emphasis is placed on applications that are likely to produce economic and social benefits and dovetail with regional development priorities on a larger scale. altogether these pilot projects in favour of regional innovation and the information society are being implemented by about fifty regional authorities and will mobilise more than a thousand public or private regional operators. included among the first generation of pilot projects were four regional technological plans completed in 1996 and six irisi about to be completed with promising results, especially as regards mobilising and drawing the attention of local operators to the importance of innovation and the information society in the context of economic development. the results will also prove useful in terms of the development of a regional strategy for public intervention in these two fields and in terms of identifying priority objectives in the context of the second programming phase (1997-99) in objective 2 regions. development planning: two types of measures are provided for in the field of development planning under article 10 of the erdf regulation. firstly the terra programme of pilot projects (to which about ecu 20 million has been allocated) is aimed at implementing innovative projects with a high european content/value concerned with the integrated development of specific areas, viz. coastal 58 for projects adopted, see chapter x. pilot projects under article 10 of the erdf regulation. 59 saxony, central macedonia, valencia, piedmont, nord/pas-de-calais and northwest england. 60 for projects adopted, see chapter x. pilot projects under article 10 of the erdf regulation. 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 79 areas, river basins, mountain areas, areas whose natural or cultural heritage is being threatened, etc. the projects relating to coastal areas are also part of the community demonstration programme of integrated development of coastal areas. a call for proposals was issued, in respect of the terra programme to regional and local authorities in the union in 1996, in response to which 142 proposals were received. a limited number of proposals was preselected following their evaluation by an independent panel of experts and by the commission and five were approved in 1996.61 moreover, pilot measures implemented in close collaboration with member states under the esdp (european spatial development perspective) cover large trans-national european areas: these measures are supplementary to and concomitant with the interreg ii c initiative and have been allocated a total of ecu 20 million. in 1996 member states were invited to put forward joint pilot measures with the same objectives as the interreg ii c initiative, of a trans-national nature and involving three different countries (including at least two member states). the member states' expressions of interest served to indicate five areas: the northern rim (denmark, finland, sweden and norway), the eastern alps (austria, italy and germany), the southeastern mediterranean (greece, italy, malta and cyprus), the rhineland-lotharingian area (belgium, luxembourg, france, germany and switzerland) and a cooperation area involving portugal, spain and morocco. the pilot measures are expected to be presented, assessed and approved in 1997. urban pilot projects: following the call for proposals issued in 1995 with an april 1996 closing date, the commission received 503 proposals for urban pilot projects, of which only 25 could be selected (this was scheduled for the beginning of 1997). the theme that recurred most often in (in more than 20% of the proposals) was that of an integrated approach to the development of urban areas. dealing with obsolescent amenities and improving the environment also featured prominently. the themes vary according to the geographical provenance of the proposals: in france, italy and austria a significant number of projects focus on exploiting the assets of medium-sized cities, whereas in france, spain and italy a number of projects also concerned aspects of suburban development not yet brought under control. other themes/topics, such as equal opportunities and information technology, have been incorporated in broader strategies. moreover, some twenty of the pilot projects for 1989-93 remained to be completed in 1996. they had reached the final phase, with upwards of 80% of erdf appropriations paid. table 1-57: measures financed under article 10 of the erdf regulation (ecu million) inter-regional cooperation - internal

post evaluation may be funded under article 7 of the erdr] regulation. such measures include studies, technical assistance and information by experts not belonging to the commission or by the commission itself. in 1996 commitments for these accompanying measures conducted at the commission's initiative totalled ecu 17.9 million, ecu 3.9 million up on the preceding year. this accounts for 0.12% of the erdf allocation (0.11% in 1995). table 1-58: measures funded under article 7 of the erdf regulation (ecu million) preparatory measures and monitoring evaluation regional studies

regulation. information measures (35%), including the publication of the first report on economic and social cohesion, contributed to making regional policies and projects funded by the commission more visible. preparatory and follow-up measures (26%) led to studies covering the implementation of community policies, in particular as regards equality of opportunity between men and women, job creation, sustainable development and the environment. expenditure on seminars and conferences (10%) includes, for instance, preparing for the april 1997 forum on economic and social cohesion, the regional seminars in objective 2 areas and a conference on inter-regional cooperation. the regional studies (0.2%) launched in 1996 are of a statistical nature. the various technical assistance measures (21%) covered experts' reports on regional policy. 2.2. innovative measures and technical assistance under article 6 of the esf regulation with regard to innovative measures, the commission decided in 1996 that the allocation of appropriations under article 6 of the esf regulation would from then on be the subject of a call for proposals administered at community level. a call for proposals was accordingly issued on 26 october 1996 on the theme of new fields of employment. an initial selection of 52 projects (from the 210 received) was carried out in respect of 1996 for a total of ecu 25 million (the projects still have to be formally approved in 1997). a second selection was due to take place in mid-1997. compliance with, and the strengthening of, of community measures centred on priority political themes have been key factors in project selection (equality of opportunity, overcoming exclusion, etc.). with regard to projects selected in earlier years there were thirty or so projects selected in 199462 and 58 projects selected in 199563 and formally adopted in april 1996, for a total of ecu 23.8 million. all these projects cover the strengthening of the employment systems, in particular the search for sharper growth in employment, improving the labour market and underpinning training systems. an evaluation system was set up for those projects in 1996 in order to assess their degree of innovation and the best practices, the results of the evaluation were expected to lead to a seminar in which, depending on the topics of concern to them, project managers, officials from the ministries of the member states and experts would take part. 62 see 1994 annual report. 63 see 1995 annual report. 8th annual report on the structural fundi (1996) 81 esf pilot projects and information society: in the context of the above-mentioned risi and risi 2 projects the esf is providing funding totalling ecu five million for eight risi projects in regions or cities in wales, midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, murcia, south west england, attica, bremen, northern karelia and blekinge. it is also funding two risi 2 projects. other pilot projects funded under article 6 of the esf regulation also underpin the process of adapting to the information society. example - internet in the school pilot project in castile-le\u00f4n: this project is aimed at introducing the internet in four schools situated in rural areas. its purpose is to make information society concepts an integral part of the practice of teaching, to enable teachers and pupils to gain access to the internet for teaching and culture purposes, to provide schools with the necessary measures, and to promote the creation of networks between the region's schools and the rest of the world in order to exchange experience, form discussion forums and promote the teaching of foreign languages. in the context of this project a server containing cultural and educational information will be set up in the region's technology park. with regard to technical assistance, implementation of the employment and adapt community initiatives was actively supported, as in 1995, by the support structure set up in 1995, europs. the year 1996 was essentially one of gathering and analysing information on the first series of projects and preparing a series of publications on the various strands of the two cis. thanks to collaboration with national support structures a guide on. trans-nationality was prepared for the benefit of project promoters. work preparatory to the launch of the second phase of projects has begun. moreover, the intermediate support structure specialising in public relations and communication activities has begun the information and communication activities for the esf. table 1-59:

concerned with evaluation, monitoring and technical assistance, pilot projects relating to the adaptation of farming structures and promoting rural development, demonstration projects, and measures necessary for the dissemination of the results of experience and work on rural development and the improvement of farm structures. measures funded in 1996 in respect of article 8 of the eaggf regulation concerned 35 pilot and demonstration projects, four dissemination projects and three studies. the commitments entered into in this respect in 1996 total ecu 15.4 million and payments ecu 9.2 million. since 1994, commitments in respect of article 8 of the eaggf regulation have totalled ecu 21.2 million and payments ecu 23.9 million. evaluation, follow-up, technical assistance and study work was aimed at prior appraisal of two multiregional ops in objective 1 regions in italy, the ex post evaluation of the leader i initiative64 and the setting up of a programme of rural indicators for underpinning a rural development policy. the pilot and demonstration projects (35 altogether), the call for proposals for which was due to close in 1995,65 were launched in 1996. they were selected on the basis of four priority fields and covered the following topics: 64 see chapter iv. evaluation. 65 see 1995 annual report. 82 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) \u0142 non-food production: growing of herbaceous species intended for the building industry, introduction of crops intended for the pharmaceutical or cosmetics industry (malaleuca alternafolia, myrrh, liquorice, aloe vera, fine lavender), processing of castor in order to extract natural aromas; \u0142 agri-environmental aspects: marketing of biocomponents and biological farming products, restoring cultivation terraces in mediterranean areas, introducing a system of mineral accounting; \u0142 forestry: regenerating burnt forests, conservation of periurban woodlands, obtaining the best return from coppice wood, optimising farming-forestry systems; \u0142 rural development: diversification in a rural environment towards high value added activities while taking conservation into account (introduction of biological products in the schools and business sector, marketing of typical agricultural products, farm tourism, etc.), innovative schemes to encourage young people to take up farming. a fresh call for proposals was issued in september 1996 for pilot, and demonstration projects for \"innovative measures for female farmers and women generally in the countryside\"66 (closing date: 20 february 1997). proposals must be aimed at supporting and promoting women in the countryside, e.g. measures undertaken by women or female farmers to promote and obtain the best return from agricultural products and retrain or diversify , measures to create jobs and integrate into society and the labour market, training or supervision measures, or the development of networks enabling them to pass on their know-how and experience. pilot projects in the field of research and technological development: pilot and demonstration projects eligible for funding under article 8 of the eaggf regulation provide an ideal opportunity for testing research findings on a scale approaching actual conditions and for demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative system, method or production technique. measures funded in 1996 thus concerned, for instance, the demonstration of a simple and effective technique for processing vegetable fibres (giant reeds and sorghum) into chipboard, the feasibility of a new technique for extracting - at farm level - natural flavourings from castor, or the application to rural firms of a technology based on the new iso 9000 quality concept. dissemination measures concerned the creation of a visual identity for rural development (logo), the publication of cards on rural development and the holding of a seminar on the ecological benefits of sustainable agriculture. 2.4. innovative action and technical assistance under article 4 of the fifg regulation in accordance with article 4 of the ftfg regulation, the measures carried out in 1996 consisted of studies, pilot projects, publications, information campaigns and technical assistance. the studies covered: fleet diagnostics and identifying measures to be carried out in the three types of fisheries occupations in the mediterranean (tuna seine fishing, trawling and minor occupations); the use made of fisheries products withdrawn from the market; and the impact of the community's autonomous quotas and suspensions on the extractive producer sector and the fisheries products processing industry. with regard to publications, the commission edited information brochures on measures to assist fishing,67 republished the report entitled \"aquaculture and environment\" and the record of the \"shellfish farming and coastal development\" conference. work began on two major events scheduled for 1997: the first euro-moroccan partnership meeting between firms from the fishing industry (casablanca '97 partnership - fishing industry) and a european information campaign designed to encourage the consumption of fisheries and aquaculture products. lastly, in the field of technical assistance, the community register of fishing vessels was updated and there was funding for training in the \"infosys\" information technology system of monitoring and evaluation of ftfg-financed structural measures. 66 call for proposals 96/c 284/10, oj no c 284, 27.9.1996. 67 see chapter iii.d.l.

(2) no payment was made under objective 4. a significant number of payments were also made in respect of operations decided on before 1994 for the first programming period (1989-93), or earlier in some cases. the overall figure amounted to ecu 1 785 million (7% of all payments made in 1996), of which ecu 1 382 million (77%) corresponded to the commitments in the period 1989-93. these are payments made as normal as the first programming period comes to a close. assuming that the commitments on these operations were made as required before the end of 1993 (except where programmes are extended), the member states had a period of two years until 31 december 1995 to make payment to the final beneficiaries and a further six months, until 30 june 1996 at the latest, to send the expenditure statements to the cornmission. the commission's payments in 1996 thus reflect the closure of the programmes for the first programming period. in 1996, 796 erdf operations relating to the period before the reform of the structural funds in 1988 were settled, often automatically under article 12 of regulation (eec) no 4254/88. the closure of operations involved paying outstanding amounts totalling ecu 401 700 000, of which ecu 378 million related to italy (645 cases), ecu 12 million to the united kingdom (97 cases), ecu 10 million to greece (22 cases) and ecu 2 million to other member states (32 cases). some 170 operations in respect of 1989-93 were closed in 1996, the outstanding amounts paid totalling ecu 535 million, of which ecu 241 million related to spain, ecu 91 million to greece, ecu 44 million to ireland, ecu 42 million to italy, ecu 40 million to portugal and ecu 77 million to other member states. esf payments related almost entirely to the first programming period and represented one more step towards closure of the programmes concerned (some have been extended). the programmes before this first period involve italy and portugal. eaggf payments made in 1996 in respect of the programming period 1989-93 amount to ecu 231 170 000. it should be noted that the member states were somewhat slow in submitting applications for outstanding balances. at the end of 1996 ecu 83 100 000 for all the objectives was still not settled because the member states had not submitted applications, portugal and france in particular for objective 1 and france and italy for objective 5(b). 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) 93 in the case of fisheries, the payments include the appropriations needed to, settle the commitments relating to

available arising from the edinburgh undertaking and carryovers from 1995 and the failure to use all the payment appropriations has an impact on the payment appropriations outstanding at the end of the year. the rate of settlement has however improved, rising to 56% in 1996 as against 46% in 1995. there were two reasons for this: the settlement of commitments for the current year and the settlement o\u00a3 appropriations committed in previous years. the appropriations outstanding that correspond to the first programming period (1989-93) represent 19% of all outstanding appropriations at the end of 1996, whereas they represented a third of those outstanding at the end of 1995. this reduction results from the closure of a very large number of programmes in 1996. thus, taking all objectives and funds together, payments have been made in respect of 85% of the appropriations committed in 1992 and 1993. the results of this closure have been most notable in the case of the erdf: outstanding erdf commitments made before 1994 were reduced from ecu 4 465 million to ecu 2 913 million in 1996. the shares of each fund in the total appropriations outstanding at the end of 1996 are: erdf: 55.6%; esf: 26.6%; eaggf: 15.2%', fifg: 2.6%. these figures differ slightly from those for 1995 (erdf: 56%; esf: 27%; eaggf: 13%; fifg: 4%) and, with the exception of the eaggf, the rate of

appropriations and 96.8% of the payment appropriations. the amounts entered in the budget were sufficient to cover the overall funding needs for each chapter. in the case of implementation of the csfs and spds, objective 1 operations were yet again the most dynamic this year in terms of their ability to draw down appropriations. the relevant budget line (b2-1200) had to be increased by ecu 115 300 000 in commitment appropriations and ecu 700 million in payment appropriations through transfers from other objectives. 1996 is a special year for objective 2 in that it is the last year of the first phase established for this objective (1994-96). in budget terms this means that all the aid had to be committed before the end of 1996 and explains why the objective 2 budget heading (b2-1201) had to be increased by ecu 162 500 000 in 96 8th annual report on the structural funds (1996) commitment appropriations. on the other hand, that same budget heading transferred ecu 584 500 000 in payment appropriations to objective 1. furthermore, as a result of the decisions to reduce the community contribution for certain objective 2 operations, ecu 37 million committed in 1994 and 1995 was decommitted. in the case of objective 5(b),, ecu 223 500 000 in commitment appropriations and ecu 80 700 000 in payment appropriations were transferred to other objectives while no commitment or payment was made in 1996 for italy, belgium, denmark or luxembourg. implementation of this objective is being hampered by funding difficulties at member state level. under objective 6, ecu 54 300 000 in commitment appropriations and ecu 34 800 000 in payment appropriations has been transferred to other headings. sweden in particular has not recorded any commitment or payment operations. in the case of the community initiatives, the implementation rates overall for erdf appropriations (chapter b2-14) amounted to 97.8% for commitment appropriations and 79.8% for payment appropriations. in 1996, the initial erdf allocations were maintained overall (ecu 7 400 000 in commitment appropriations and ecu 8 million in payment appropriations were released to other funds). large movements of appropriations between initiatives proved necessary, however, to satisfy the varying paces at which funding was being taken up. thus, the commitment appropriations for the pesca, interreg, regis and urban initiatives had to be supplemented using appropriations taken from other initiatives. the total amount of erdf appropriations transferred between community initiatives amounted to ecu 276 400 000, of which interreg alone accounted for ecu 127 800 000. in addition, a significant proportion of the commitments (ecu 730 700 000) arose directly from the adoption of new programmes. this is particularly the case for the three new member states but also for those other programmes whose approval by the cornmission was delayed. lastly, the first decisions to grant aid from the financial reserve for the community initiatives were taken in 1996. the amounts engaged were not large, however. lastly, as regards the transitional and innovative measures, erdf implementation (article b2-182) amounted to ecu 52.5% in commitment appropriations and ecu 72.8% in payment appropriations. this budget heading finances measures adopted by the commission under articles 7 and 10 of the erdf regulation and article 16 of the regulation coordinating the structural funds. the new procedures adopted by the commission for adopting article 101 pilot projects ran into unexpected implementation difficulties, which resulted in delayed approval of the projects and, as'a further consequence, slack take-up of commitment appropriations. the late start will be made up for in 1997 and 1998. see

37.17 23.64 964 36 to take account of actual progress on the ground, the esf appropriations (both commitments and payments) available in 1996 were rebalanced in the chapter, resulting in rates of implementation of almost 100% for commitment appropriations and 93% for payment appropriations, compared to 1995, when implementation was 76% for commitment appropriations and 81% for payment appropriations. the result was achieved thanks to close cooperation with the member states through the introduction of a forecast system that will now be maintained. as for progress under each objective, in the case of objective 1 it is likely that portugal and, to a lesser extent, the united kingdom will offset the feeble results achieved in greece and italy. in the case of objective 2, work in spain and germany is helping to offset the slow progress made by the french, italian and united kingdom spds. germany and the united kingdom are making good 98 8th annual report on the structural fund* (1996) progress under objective 3, while all member states are experiencing delays, under objectives 4 and 5(b). sweden is somewhat behind in implementing objective 6. various transfers were made between the community initiatives during the year to take account of the reprogramming of numerous programmes due to their late launch in 1994 and the inclusion of amounts from the reserve. overall, 89% of the esf commitments appropriations relating to article b2-14 were used, as were 81% of the payment appropriations. under article b2-142, the implementation rates were 96% and 91% respectively. in the case of the employment initiative, implementation reached almost 100% for both commitment and payment appropriations while the rates for adapt were 92% for-commitments and 80% for payments. the late adoption of the programmes and the esf's specific computer requirements were the root cause of these relatively poor rates. 8th annual report on the structural fund* (1996) 99
