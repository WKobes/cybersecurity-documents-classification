interviews shall also be conducted with other individuals who are in a position to give an unbiased assessment of the individual\u2019s background, activities, loyalty, trustworthiness and reliability. when it is national practice to ask the subject of the investigation for referrals, referees shall be interviewed unless there are good reasons for not doing so. 12. where necessary and in accordance with national laws and regulations, additional investigations may be conducted to develop all relevant information available on an individual and to substantiate or disprove adverse information. renewal of a security clearance 13. after the initial granting of a security clearance and provided that the individual has had uninterrupted service with a national administration or the gsc and has a continuing need for access to euci, the security clearance shall be reviewed for renewal at intervals not exceeding 5 years for a tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret clearance and 10 years for secret ue/eu secret and confidentiel ue/eu confidential clearances, with effect from the date of notification of the outcome of the last security investigation on which they were based. all security investigations for renewing a security clearance shall cover the period since the previous such investigation. 14. for renewing security clearances, the elements outlined in paragraphs 10 and 11 shall be investigated. 15. requests for renewal shall be made in a timely manner taking account of the time required for security investigations. nevertheless, where the relevant nsa or other competent national authority has received the relevant request for renewal and the corresponding personnel security questionnaire before a security clearance expires, and the necessary security investigation has not been completed, the competent national authority may, where admissible under national laws and regulations, extend the validity of the existing security clearance for a period of up to 12 months. if, at the end of this 12-month period, the security investigation has still not been completed, the individual shall be assigned to duties which do not require a security clearance. authorisation procedures in the gsc 16. for officials and other servants in the gsc, the gsc security authority shall forward the completed personnel security questionnaire to the nsa of the member state of which the individual is a national requesting that a security investigation be undertaken for the level of euci to which the individual will require access. 17. where information relevant for a security investigation becomes known to the gsc concerning an individual who has applied for a security clearance for access to euci, the gsc, acting in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations, shall notify the relevant nsa thereof. 18. following completion of the security investigation, the relevant nsa shall notify the gsc security authority of the outcome of such an investigation, using the standard format for the correspondence prescribed by the security committee. (a) where the security investigation results in an assurance that nothing adverse is known which would call into question the loyalty, trustworthiness and reliability of the individual, the gsc appointing authority may grant the individual concerned authorisation for access to euci up to the relevant level until a specified date. (b) where the security investigation does not result in such an assurance, the gsc appointing authority shall notify the individual concerned, who may ask to be heard by the appointing authority. the appointing authority may ask the competent nsa for any further clarification it can provide according to its national laws and regulations. if the outcome is confirmed, authorisation shall not be granted for access to euci. 19. the security investigation together with the results obtained shall be subject to the relevant laws and regulations in force in the member state concerned, including those concerning appeals. decisions by the gsc appointing authority shall be subject to appeals in accordance with the staff regulations of officials of the european union and the conditions of employment of other servants of the european union, laid down in council regulation (eec, euratom, ecsc) no 259/68 ( 4 ) (\u2018the staff regulations and conditions of employment\u2019). 20. national experts seconded to the gsc for a position requiring access to euci classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential and above shall present a valid personnel security clearance certificate (pscc) for access to euci to the gsc security authority prior to taking up their assignment, on the basis of which the appointing authority shall issue an authorisation for access to euci. 21. the gsc will accept the authorisation for access to euci granted by any other union institution, body or agency, provided it remains valid. authorisation will cover any assignment by the individual concerned within the gsc. the union institution, body or agency in which the individual is taking up employment will notify the relevant nsa of the change of employer. 22. if an individual\u2019s period of service does not commence within 12 months of the notification of the outcome of the security investigation to the gsc appointing authority, or if there is a break of 12 months in an individual\u2019s service, during which time he has not been employed in the gsc or in a position with a national administration of a member state, this outcome shall be referred to the relevant nsa for confirmation that it remains valid and appropriate. 23. where information becomes known to the gsc concerning a security risk posed by an individual who has authorisation for access to euci, the gsc, acting in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations, shall notify the relevant nsa thereof and may suspend access to euci or withdraw authorisation for access to euci. 24. where an nsa notifies the gsc of withdrawal of an assurance given in accordance with paragraph 18(a) for an individual who has authorisation for access to euci, the gsc appointing authority may ask for any clarification the nsa can provide according to its national laws and regulations. if the adverse information is confirmed, authorisation shall be withdrawn and the individual shall be excluded from access to euci and from positions where such access is possible or where he might endanger security . 25. any decision to withdraw or suspend an authorisation from a gsc official or other servant for access to euci and, where appropriate, the reasons for doing so shall be notified to the individual concerned, who may ask to be heard by the appointing authority. information provided by an nsa shall be subject to the relevant laws and regulations in force in the member state concerned, including those concerning appeals. decisions by the gsc appointing authority shall be subject to appeals in accordance with the staff regulations and conditions of employment. records of security clearances and authorisations 26. records of pscs and authorisations granted for access to information classified as confidentiel ue/eu confidential or above shall be maintained respectively by each member state and by the gsc. these records shall contain as a minimum the level of euci to which the individual may be granted access, the date the security clearance was granted and its period of validity. 27. the competent security authority may issue a pscc showing the level of euci to which the individual may be granted access (confidentiel ue/eu confidential or above), the date of validity of the relevant psc for access to euci or authorisation for access to euci and the date of expiry of the certificate itself. exemptions from the psc requirement 28. access to euci by individuals in member states duly authorised by virtue of their functions shall be determined in accordance with national laws and regulations; such individuals shall be briefed on their security obligations in respect of protecting euci. iv. security education and awareness 29. all individuals who have been granted a security clearance shall acknowledge in writing that they have understood their obligations in respect of protecting euci and the consequences if euci is compromised. a record of such a written acknowledgement shall be kept by the member state and by the gsc, as appropriate. 30. all individuals who are authorised to have access to, or required to handle euci, shall initially be made aware, and periodically briefed on the threats to security and must report immediately to the appropriate security authorities any approach or activity that they consider suspicious or unusual. 31. all individuals who cease to be employed in duties requiring access to euci shall be made aware of, and where appropriate acknowledge in writing, their obligations in respect of the continued protection of euci. v. exceptional circumstances 32. where permissible under national laws and regulations, security clearance granted by a competent national authority of a member state for access to national classified information may, for a temporary period pending the granting of a psc for access to euci, allow access by national officials to euci up to the equivalent level specified in the table of equivalence in appendix b where such temporary access is required in the interests of the union. nsas shall inform the security committee where national laws and regulations do not permit such temporary access to euci. 33. for reasons of urgency, where duly justified in the interests of the service and pending completion of a full security investigation, the gsc appointing authority may, after consulting the nsa of the member state of whom the individual is a national and subject to the outcome of preliminary checks to verify that no adverse information is known, grant a temporary authorisation for gsc officials and other servants to access euci for a specific function. such temporary authorisations shall be valid for a period not exceeding 6 months and shall not permit access to information classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret. all individuals who have been granted a temporary authorisation shall acknowledge in writing that they have understood their obligations in respect of protecting euci and the consequences if euci is compromised. a record of such a written acknowledgement shall be kept by the gsc. 34. when an individual is to be assigned to a position that requires a security clearance at one level higher than that currently possessed by the individual, the assignment may be made on a provisional basis, provided that: (a) the compelling need for access to euci at a higher level shall be justified, in writing, by the individual\u2019s superior; (b) access shall be limited to specific items of euci in support of the assignment; (c) the individual holds a valid psc or authorisation for access to euci; (d) action has been initiated to obtain authorisation for the level of access required for the position; (e) satisfactory checks have been made by the competent authority that the individual has not seriously or repeatedly infringed security regulations; (f) the assignment of the individual is approved by the competent authority; and (g) a record of the exception, including a description of the information to which access was approved, shall be kept by the registry or subordinate registry responsible. 35. the above procedure shall be used for one-time access to euci at one level higher than that to which the individual has been security cleared. recourse to this procedure shall not be made on a recurring basis. 36. in very exceptional circumstances, such as missions in hostile environments or during periods of mounting international tension when emergency measures require it, in particular for the purposes of saving lives, member states and the secretary-general may grant, where possible in writing, access to information classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential or secret ue/eu secret to individuals who do not possess the requisite security clearance, provided that such permission is absolutely necessary and there are no reasonable doubts as to the loyalty, trustworthiness and reliability of the individual concerned. a record shall be kept of this permission describing the information to which access was approved. 37. in the case of information classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret, this emergency access shall be confined to union nationals who have been authorised access to either the national equivalent of tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret or information classified secret ue/eu secret. 38. the security committee shall be informed of cases when recourse is made to the procedure set out in paragraphs 36 and 37. 39. where national laws and regulations of a member state stipulate more stringent rules with respect to temporary authorisations, provisional assignments, one-time access or emergency access by individuals to classified information, the procedures foreseen in this section shall be implemented only within any limitations set forth in the relevant national laws and regulations. 40. the security committee shall receive an annual report on recourse to the procedures set out in this section. vi. attendance at meetings in the council 41. subject to paragraph 28, individuals assigned to participate in meetings of the council or of council preparatory bodies at which information classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential or above is discussed may only do so upon confirmation of the individual\u2019s security clearance status. for delegates, a pscc or other proof of security clearance shall be forwarded by the appropriate authorities to the gsc security office, or exceptionally be presented by the delegate concerned. where applicable, a consolidated list of names may be used, giving the relevant proof of security clearance. 42. where a psc for access to euci is withdrawn for security reasons from an individual whose duties require attendance at meetings of the council or of council preparatory bodies, the competent authority shall inform the gsc thereof. vii. potential access to euci 43. couriers, guards and escorts shall be security cleared to the relevant level or otherwise appropriately investigated in accordance with national laws and regulations, be briefed on security procedures for protecting euci and be instructed on their duties for protecting such information entrusted to them. annex ii physical security i. introduction 1. this annex sets out provisions for implementing article 8. it lays down minimum requirements for the physical protection of premises, buildings, offices, rooms and other areas where euci is handled and stored, including areas housing cis. 2. physical security measures shall be designed to prevent unauthorised access to euci by: (a) ensuring that euci is handled and stored in an appropriate manner; (b) allowing for segregation of personnel in terms of access to euci on the basis of their need-to-know and, where appropriate, their security clearance; (c) deterring, impeding and detecting unauthorised actions; and (d) denying or delaying surreptitious or forced entry by intruders. ii. physical security requirements and measures 3. physical security measures shall be selected on the basis of a threat assessment made by the competent authorities. the gsc and member states shall each apply a risk management process for protecting euci on their premises to ensure that a commensurate level of physical protection is afforded against the assessed risk. the risk management process shall take account of all relevant factors, in particular: (a) the classification level of euci; (b) the form and volume of euci, bearing in mind that large quantities or a compilation of euci may require more stringent protective measures to be applied; (c) the surrounding environment and structure of the buildings or areas housing euci; and (d) the assessed threat from intelligence services which target the union or member states and from sabotage, terrorist, subversive or other criminal activities. 4. the competent security authority, applying the concept of defence in depth, shall determine the appropriate combination of physical security measures to be implemented. these can include one or more of the following: (a) a perimeter barrier: a physical barrier which defends the boundary of an area requiring protection; (b) intrusion detection systems (ids): an ids may be used to enhance the level of security offered by a perimeter barrier, or in rooms and buildings in place of, or to assist, security staff; (c) access control: access control may be exercised over a site, a building or buildings on a site or to areas or rooms within a building. control may be exercised by electronic or electro-mechanical means, by security personnel and/or a receptionist, or by any other physical means; (d) security personnel: trained, supervised and, where necessary, appropriately security -cleared security personnel may be employed, inter alia, in order to deter individuals planning covert intrusion; (e) closed circuit television (cctv): cctv may be used by security personnel in order to verify incidents and ids alarms on large sites or at perimeters; (f) security lighting: security lighting may be used to deter a potential intruder, as well as to provide the illumination necessary for effective surveillance directly by security personnel or indirectly through a cctv system; and (g) any other appropriate physical measures designed to deter or detect unauthorised access or prevent loss of or damage to euci. 5. the competent authority can be authorised to conduct entry and exit searches to act as a deterrent to the unauthorised introduction of material or the unauthorised removal of euci from premises or buildings. 6. when euci is at risk from overlooking, even accidentally, appropriate measures shall be taken to counter this risk. 7. for new facilities, physical security requirements and their functional specifications shall be defined as part of the planning and design of the facilities. for existing facilities, physical security requirements shall be implemented to the maximum extent possible. iii. equipment for the physical protection of euci 8. when acquiring equipment (such as security containers, shredding machines, door locks, electronic access control systems, ids, alarm systems) for the physical protection of euci, the competent security authority shall ensure that the equipment meets approved technical standards and minimum requirements. 9. the technical specifications of equipment to be used for the physical protection of euci shall be set out in security guidelines to be approved by the security committee. 10. security systems shall be inspected at regular intervals and equipment shall be maintained regularly. maintenance work shall take account of the outcome of inspections to ensure that equipment continues to operate at optimum performance. 11. the effectiveness of individual security measures and of the overall security system shall be re-evaluated during each inspection. iv. physically protected areas 12. two types of physically protected areas, or the national equivalents thereof, shall be established for the physical protection of euci: (a) administrative areas; and (b) secured areas (including technically secured areas). in this decision, all references to administrative areas and secured areas, including technically secured areas, shall be understood as also referring to the national equivalents thereof. 13. the competent security authority shall establish that an area meets the requirements to be designated as an administrative area, a secured area or a technically secured area. 14. for administrative areas: (a) a visibly defined perimeter shall be established which allows individuals and, where possible, vehicles to be checked; (b) unescorted access shall be granted only to individuals who are duly authorised by the competent authority; and (c) all other individuals shall be escorted at all times or be subject to equivalent controls. 15. for secured areas: (a) a visibly defined and protected perimeter shall be established through which all entry and exit are controlled by means of a pass or personal recognition system; (b) unescorted access shall be granted only to individuals who are security -cleared and specifically authorised to enter the area on the basis of their need-to-know; and (c) all other individuals shall be escorted at all times or be subject to equivalent controls. 16. where entry into a secured area constitutes, for all practical purposes, direct access to the classified information contained in it, the following additional requirements shall apply: (a) the level of highest security classification of the information normally held in the area shall be clearly indicated; (b) all visitors shall require specific authorisation to enter the area, shall be escorted at all times and shall be appropriately security cleared unless steps are taken to ensure that no access to euci is possible. 17. secured areas protected against eavesdropping shall be designated technically secured areas. the following additional requirements shall apply: (a) such areas shall be ids equipped, be locked when not occupied and be guarded when occupied. any keys shall be controlled in accordance with section vi; (b) all persons and material entering such areas shall be controlled; (c) such areas shall be regularly physically and/or technically inspected as required by the competent security authority. such inspections shall also be conducted following any unauthorised entry or suspicion of such entry; and (d) such areas shall be free of unauthorised communication lines, unauthorised telephones or other unauthorised communication devices and electrical or electronic equipment. 18. notwithstanding point (d) of paragraph 17, before being used in areas where meetings are held or work is being performed involving information classified secret ue/eu secret and above, and where the threat to euci is assessed as high, any communications devices and electrical or electronic equipment shall first be examined by the competent security authority to ensure that no intelligible information can be inadvertently or illicitly transmitted by such equipment beyond the perimeter of the secured area. 19. secured areas which are not occupied by duty personnel on a 24-hour basis shall, where appropriate, be inspected at the end of normal working hours and at random intervals outside normal working hours, unless an ids is in place. 20. secured areas and technically secured areas may be set up temporarily within an administrative area for a classified meeting or any other similar purpose. 21. security operating procedures shall be drawn up for each secured area stipulating: (a) the level of euci which may be handled and stored in the area; (b) the surveillance and protective measures to be maintained; (c) the individuals authorised to have unescorted access to the area by virtue of their need-to-know and security clearance; (d) where appropriate, the procedures for escorts or for protecting euci when authorising any other individuals to access the area; and (e) any other relevant measures and procedures. 22. strong rooms shall be constructed within secured areas. the walls, floors, ceilings, windows and lockable doors shall be approved by the competent security authority and afford protection equivalent to a security container approved for the storage of euci of the same classification level. v. physical protective measures for handling and storing euci 23. euci which is classified restreint ue/eu restricted may be handled: (a) in a secured area; (b) in an administrative area provided the euci is protected from access by unauthorised individuals; or (c) outside a secured area or an administrative area provided the holder carries the euci in accordance with paragraphs 28 to 41 of annex iii and has undertaken to comply with compensatory measures laid down in security instructions issued by the competent security authority to ensure that euci is protected from access by unauthorised persons. 24. euci which is classified restreint ue/eu restricted shall be stored in suitable locked office furniture in an administrative area or a secured area. it may temporarily be stored outside a secured area or an administrative area provided the holder has undertaken to comply with compensatory measures laid down in security instructions issued by the competent security authority. 25. euci which is classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential or secret ue/eu secret may be handled: (a) in a secured area; (b) in an administrative area provided the euci is protected from access by unauthorised individuals; or (c) outside a secured area or an administrative area provided the holder: (i) carries the euci in accordance with paragraphs 28 to 41 of annex iii; (ii) has undertaken to comply with compensatory measures laid down in security instructions issued by the competent security authority to ensure that euci is protected from access by unauthorised persons; (iii) keeps the euci at all times under his personal control; and (iv) in the case of documents in paper form, has notified the relevant registry of the fact. 26. euci which is classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential and secret ue/eu secret shall be stored in a secured area either in a security container or in a strong room. 27. euci which is classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret shall be handled in a secured area. 28. euci which is classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret shall be stored in a secured area under one of the following conditions: (a) in a security container in line with paragraph 8 with at least one of the following supplementary controls: (i) continuous protection or verification by cleared security staff or duty personnel; (ii) an approved ids in combination with response security personnel; (b) in an ids-equipped strong room in combination with response security personnel. 29. rules governing the carriage of euci outside physically protected areas are set out in annex iii. vi. control of keys and combinations used for protecting euci 30. the competent security authority shall define procedures for managing keys and combination settings for offices, rooms, strong rooms and security containers. such procedures shall protect against unauthorised access. 31. combination settings shall be committed to memory by the smallest possible number of individuals needing to know them. combination settings for security containers and strong rooms storing euci shall be changed: (a) on receipt of a new container; (b) whenever there is a change in personnel knowing the combination; (c) whenever a compromise has occurred or is suspected; (d) when a lock has undergone maintenance or repair; and (e) at least every 12 months. annex iii management of classified information i. introduction 1. this annex sets out provisions for implementing article 9. it lays down the administrative measures for controlling euci throughout its life-cycle in order to help deter and detect deliberate or accidental compromise or loss of such information. ii. classification management classifications and markings 2. information shall be classified where it requires protection with regard to its confidentiality. 3. the originator of euci shall be responsible for determining the security classification level, in accordance with the relevant classification guidelines, and for the initial dissemination of the information. 4. the classification level of euci shall be determined in accordance with article 2(2) and by reference to the security policy to be approved in accordance with article 3(3). 5. the security classification shall be clearly and correctly indicated, regardless of whether the euci is on paper, oral, electronic or in any other form. 6. individual parts of a given document (i.e. pages, paragraphs, sections, annexes, appendices, attachments and enclosures) may require different classifications and shall be marked accordingly, including when stored in electronic form. 7. the overall classification level of a document or file shall be at least as high as that of its most highly classified component. when information from various sources is collated, the final product shall be reviewed to determine its overall security classification level, since it may warrant a higher classification than its component parts. 8. to the extent possible, documents containing parts with different classification levels shall be structured so that parts with a different classification level may be easily identified and detached if necessary. 9. the classification of a letter or note covering enclosures shall be as high as the highest classification of its enclosures. the originator shall indicate clearly at which level it is classified when detached from its enclosures by means of an appropriate marking, e.g.: confidentiel ue/eu confidential without attachment(s) restreint ue/eu restricted markings 10. in addition to one of the security classification markings set out in article 2(2), euci may bear additional markings, such as: (a) an identifier to designate the originator; (b) any caveats, code-words or acronyms specifying the field of activity to which the document relates, a particular distribution on a need-to-know basis or restrictions on use; (c) releasability markings; or (d) where applicable, the date or specific event after which it may be downgraded or declassified. abbreviated classification markings 11. standardised abbreviated classification markings may be used to indicate the classification level of individual paragraphs of a text. abbreviations shall not replace the full classification markings. 12. the following standard abbreviations may be used within eu classified documents to indicate the classification level of sections or blocks of text of less than a single page: tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret ts-ue/eu-ts secret ue/eu secret s-ue/eu-s confidentiel ue/eu confidential c-ue/eu-c restreint ue/eu restricted r-ue/eu-r creation of euci 13. when creating an eu classified document: (a) each page shall be marked clearly with the classification level; (b) each page shall be numbered; (c) the document shall bear a reference number and a subject, which is not itself classified information, unless it is marked as such; (d) the document shall be dated; and (e) documents classified secret ue/eu secret or above shall bear a copy number on every page, if they are to be distributed in several copies. 14. where it is not possible to apply paragraph 13 to euci, other appropriate measures shall be taken in accordance with security guidelines to be established pursuant to article 6(2). downgrading and declassification of euci 15. at the time of its creation, the originator shall indicate, where possible, and in particular for information classified restreint ue/eu restricted, whether euci can be downgraded or declassified on a given date or following a specific event. 16. the gsc shall regularly review euci held by it to ascertain whether the classification level still applies. the gsc shall establish a system to review the classification level of euci which it has originated no less frequently than every five years. such a review shall not be necessary where the originator has indicated from the outset that the information will automatically be downgraded or declassified and the information has been marked accordingly. iii. registration of euci for security purposes 17. for every organisational entity within the gsc and member states\u2019 national administrations in which euci is handled, a responsible registry shall be identified to ensure that euci is handled in accordance with this decision. registries shall be established as secured areas as defined in annex ii. 18. for the purposes of this decision, registration for security purposes (\u2018registration\u2019) means the application of procedures which record the life-cycle of material, including its dissemination and destruction. 19. all material classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential and above shall be registered in designated registries when it arrives at or leaves an organisational entity. 20. the central registry within the gsc shall keep a record of all classified information released by the council and the gsc to third states and international organisations, and of all classified information received from third states or international organisations. 21. in the case of a cis, registration procedures may be performed by processes within the cis itself. 22. the council shall approve a security policy on the registration of euci for security purposes. tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret registries 23. a registry shall be designated in the member states and in the gsc to act as the central receiving and dispatching authority for information classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret. where necessary, subordinate registries may be designated to handle such information for registration purposes. 24. such subordinate registries may not transmit tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret documents directly to other subordinate registries of the same central tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret registry or externally without the express written approval of the latter. iv. copying and translating eu classified documents 25. tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret documents shall not be copied or translated without the prior written consent of the originator. 26. where the originator of documents classified secret ue/eu secret and below has not imposed caveats on their copying or translation, such documents may be copied or translated on instruction from the holder. 27. the security measures applicable to the original document shall apply to copies and translations thereof. v. carriage of euci 28. carriage of euci shall be subject to the protective measures set out in paragraphs 30 to 41. when euci is carried on electronic media, and notwithstanding article 9(4), the protective measures set out below may be supplemented by appropriate technical countermeasures prescribed by the competent security authority so as to minimise the risk of loss or compromise. 29. the competent security authorities in the gsc and in member states shall issue instructions on the carriage of euci in accordance with this decision. within a building or self-contained group of buildings 30. euci carried within a building or self-contained group of buildings shall be covered in order to prevent observation of its contents. 31. within a building or self-contained group of buildings, information classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret shall be carried in a secured envelope bearing only the addressee\u2019s name. within the union 32. euci carried between buildings or premises within the union shall be packaged so that it is protected from unauthorised disclosure. 33. the carriage of information classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential or secret ue/eu secret within the union shall

stored in accordance with the requirements set out in annex ii; (ii) euci is not opened en route or read in public places; (iii) individuals are briefed on their security responsibilities; and (iv) individuals are provided with a courier certificate where necessary; (c) postal services or commercial courier services, provided that: (i) they are approved by the relevant nsa in accordance with national laws and regulations; and (ii) they apply appropriate protective measures in accordance with minimum requirements to be laid down in security guidelines pursuant to article 6(2). in the case of carriage from one member state to another, the provisions of point (c) shall be limited to information classified up to confidentiel ue/eu confidential. 34. information classified restreint ue/eu restricted may also be carried by postal services or commercial courier services. a courier certificate is not required for the carriage of such information. 35. material classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential and secret ue/eu secret (e.g. equipment or machinery) which cannot be carried by the means referred to in paragraph 33 shall be transported as freight by commercial carrier companies in accordance with annex v. 36. the carriage of information classified tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret between buildings or premises within the union shall be by military, government or diplomatic courier, as appropriate. from within the union to the territory of a third state 37. euci carried from within the union to the territory of a third state shall be packaged in such a way that it is protected from unauthorised disclosure. 38. the carriage of information classified confidentiel ue/eu confidential and secret ue/eu secret from within the union to the territory of a third state shall

following ia properties and concepts are essential for the security and correct functioning of operations on cis: authenticity : the guarantee that information is genuine and from bona fide sources; availability : the property of being accessible and usable upon request by an authorised entity; confidentiality : the property that information is not disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes; integrity : the property of safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and assets; non-repudiation : the ability to prove an action or event has taken place, so that this event or action cannot subsequently be denied. ii. information assurance principles 3. the provisions set out below shall form the baseline for the security of any cis handling euci. detailed requirements for implementing these provisions shall be defined in ia security policies and security guidelines. security risk management 4. security risk management shall be an integral part of defining, developing, operating and maintaining cis. risk management (assessment, treatment, acceptance and communication) shall be conducted as an iterative process jointly by representatives of the system owners, project authorities, operating authorities and security approval authorities, using a proven, transparent and fully understandable risk assessment process. the scope of the cis and its assets shall be clearly defined at the outset of the risk management process. 5. the competent authorities shall review the potential threats to cis and shall maintain up-to-date and accurate threat assessments which reflect the current operational environment. they shall constantly update their knowledge of vulnerability issues and periodically review the vulnerability assessment to keep up with the changing information technology (it) environment. 6. the aim of security risk treatment shall be to apply a set of security measures which results in a satisfactory balance between user requirements, cost and residual security risk. 7. the specific requirements, scale and the degree of detail determined by the relevant saa for accrediting a cis shall be commensurate with the assessed risk, taking account of all relevant factors, including the classification level of the euci handled in the cis. accreditation shall include a formal residual risk statement and acceptance of the residual risk by a responsible authority. security throughout the cis life-cycle 8. ensuring security shall be a requirement throughout the entire cis life-cycle from initiation to withdrawal from service. 9. the role and interaction of each actor involved in a cis with regard to its security shall be identified for each phase of the life-cycle. 10. any cis, including its technical and non-technical security measures, shall be subject to security testing during the accreditation process to ensure that the appropriate level of assurance is obtained and to verify that they are correctly implemented, integrated and configured. 11. security assessments, inspections and reviews shall be performed periodically during the operation and maintenance of a cis and when exceptional circumstances arise. 12. security documentation for a cis shall evolve over its life-cycle as an integral part of the process of change and configuration management. best practice 13. the gsc and the member states shall cooperate to develop best practice for protecting euci handled on cis. best practice guidelines shall set out technical, physical, organisational and procedural security measures for cis with proven effectiveness in countering given threats and vulnerabilities. 14. the protection of euci handled on cis shall draw on lessons learned by entities involved in ia within and outside the union. 15. the dissemination and subsequent implementation of best practice shall help achieve an equivalent level of assurance for the various cis operated by the gsc and by member states which handle euci. defence in depth 16. to mitigate risk to cis, a range of technical and non-technical security measures, organised as multiple layers of defence, shall be implemented. these layers shall include: (a) deterrence : security measures aimed at dissuading any adversary planning to attack the cis; (b) prevention : security measures aimed at impeding or blocking an attack on the cis; (c) detection : security measures aimed at discovering the occurrence of an attack on the cis; (d) resilience : security measures aimed at limiting impact of an attack to a minimum set of information or cis assets and preventing further damage; and (e) recovery : security measures aimed at regaining a secure situation for the cis. the degree of stringency of such security measures shall be determined following a risk assessment. 17. the nsa or other competent authority shall ensure that: (a) cyber defence capabilities are implemented to respond to threats which may transcend organisational and national boundaries; and (b) responses are coordinated and information about these threats, incidents and the related risk is shared (computer emergency response capabilities). principle of minimality and least privilege 18. only the essential functionalities, devices and services to meet operational requirements shall be implemented in order to avoid unnecessary risk. 19. cis users and automated processes shall be given only the access, privileges or authorisations they require to perform their tasks in order to limit any damage resulting from accidents, errors, or unauthorised use of cis resources. 20. registration procedures performed by a cis, where required, shall be verified as part of the accreditation process. information assurance awareness 21. awareness of the risks and available security measures is the first line of defence for the security of cis. in particular all personnel involved in the life-cycle of cis, including users, shall understand: (a) that security failures may significantly harm the cis; (b) the potential harm to others which may arise from interconnectivity and interdependency; and (c) their individual responsibility and accountability for the security of cis according to their roles within the systems and processes. 22. to ensure that security responsibilities are understood, ia education and awareness training shall be mandatory for all personnel involved, including senior management and cis users. evaluation and approval of it- security products 23. the required degree of confidence in the security measures, defined as a level of assurance, shall be determined following the outcome of the risk management process and in line with the relevant security policies and security guidelines. 24. the level of assurance shall be verified by using internationally recognised or nationally approved processes and methodologies. this includes primarily evaluation, controls and auditing. 25. cryptographic products for protecting euci shall be evaluated and approved by a national caa of a member state. 26. prior to being recommended for approval by the council or the secretary-general in accordance with article 10(6), such cryptographic products shall have undergone a successful second party evaluation by an appropriately qualified authority (aqua) of a member state not involved in the design or manufacture of the equipment. the degree of detail required in a second party evaluation shall depend on the envisaged maximum classification level of euci to be protected by these products. the council shall approve a security policy on the evaluation and approval of cryptographic products. 27. where warranted on specific operational grounds, the council or the secretary-general as appropriate may, upon recommendation by the security committee, waive the requirements under paragraphs 25 or 26 of this annex and grant an interim approval for a specific period in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 10(6). 28. the council, acting upon recommendation by the security committee, may accept the evaluation, selection and approval process of cryptographic products of a third state or international organisation and accordingly deem such cryptographic products approved for protecting euci released to that third state or international organisation. 29. an aqua shall be a caa of a member state that has been accredited on the basis of criteria laid down by the council to undertake the second evaluation of cryptographic products for protecting euci. 30. the council shall approve a security policy on the qualification and approval of non-cryptographic it security products. transmission within secured and administrative areas 31. notwithstanding the provisions of this decision, when transmission of euci is confined within secured areas or administrative areas, unencrypted transmission or encryption at a lower level may be used based on the outcome of a risk management

accredited cis and an unprotected or public network, except where the cis has approved bps installed for such a purpose between the cis and the unprotected or public network. the security measures for such interconnections shall be reviewed by the competent iaa and approved by the competent saa. when the unprotected or public network is used solely as a carrier and the data is encrypted by a cryptographic product approved in accordance with article 10, such a connection shall not be deemed to be an interconnection. 36. the direct or cascaded interconnection of a cis accredited to handle tr\u00e8s secret ue/eu top secret to an unprotected or public network shall be prohibited. computer storage media 37. computer storage media shall be destroyed in accordance with procedures approved by the competent security authority. 38. computer storage media shall be reused, downgraded or declassified in accordance with security guidelines to be established pursuant to article 6(2). emergency circumstances 39. notwithstanding the provisions of this decision, the specific procedures described below may be applied in an emergency, such as during impending or actual crisis, conflict, war situations or in exceptional operational circumstances. 40. euci may be transmitted using cryptographic products which have been approved for a lower classification level or without encryption with the consent of the competent authority if any delay would cause harm clearly outweighing the harm entailed by any disclosure of the classified material and if: (a) the sender and recipient do not have the required encryption facility or have no encryption facility; and (b) the classified material cannot be conveyed in time by other means. 41. classified information transmitted under the circumstances set out in paragraph 39 shall not bear any markings or indications distinguishing it from information which is unclassified or which can be protected by an available cryptographic product. recipients shall be notified of the classification level, without delay, by other means. 42. should recourse be made to paragraph 39 a subsequent report shall be made to the competent authority and to the security committee. iii. information assurance functions and authorities 43. the following ia functions shall be established in the member states and the gsc. these functions do

standards governing the exchange of classified information between the union and a third state or international organisation. 6. security of information agreements shall provide for technical implementing arrangements to be agreed between the competent security authorities of the relevant union institutions and bodies and the competent security authority of the third state or international organisation in question. such arrangements shall take account of the level of protection provided by the security regulations, structures and procedures in place in the third state or international organisation concerned. they shall be approved by the security committee. 7. no euci shall be exchanged under a security of information agreement by electronic means unless explicitly provided for in the agreement or in corresponding technical implementing arrangements. 8. when the council concludes a security of information agreement, a registry shall be designated in each party as the main point of entry and exit for classified information exchanges. 9. in order to assess the effectiveness of the security regulations, structures and procedures in the third state or international organisation concerned, assessment visits shall be conducted in mutual agreement with the third state or international organisation concerned. such assessment visits shall be conducted in accordance with the relevant provisions of annex iii and shall evaluate: (a) the regulatory framework applicable for protecting classified information; (b) any specific features of the security policy and the way in which security is organised in the third state or international organisation which may have an impact on the level of classified information that may be exchanged; (c) the security measures and procedures actually in place; and (d) security clearance procedures for the level of euci to be released. 10. the team conducting an assessment visit on behalf of the union shall assess whether the security regulations and procedures in the third state or international organisation in question are adequate for the protection of euci at a given level. 11. the findings of such visits shall be set out in a report on the basis of which the security committee shall determine the maximum level of euci which may be exchanged in hard copy, and where appropriate electronically, with the third party concerned as well as any specific conditions governing exchange with that party. 12. every endeavour shall be made to conduct a full security assessment visit to the third state or international organisation in question before the security committee approves the implementing arrangements in order to establish the nature and the effectiveness of the security system in place. however, where this is not possible the security committee shall receive as full a report as possible from the gsc security office, based on the information available to it, informing the security committee about the security regulations applicable and the way in which security is organised in the third state or international organisation concerned. 13. the report on the assessment visit, or in the absence of such a report the report referred to in paragraph 12, shall be forwarded to, and deemed satisfactory by, the security committee before euci is actually released to the third state or international organisation in question. 14. the competent security authorities of the union institutions and bodies shall communicate to the third state or international organisation the date as from when the union is in a position to release euci under the agreement, as well as the maximum level of euci which may be exchanged in paper form or by electronic means. 15. follow-up assessment visits shall be conducted as necessary, in particular if: (a) there is a need for the releasable level of euci to be raised; (b) the union has been notified of fundamental changes in the third state or international organisation\u2019s security arrangements that might have an impact on how it protects euci; or (c) there has been a serious incident involving unauthorised disclosure of euci. 16. once the security of information agreement is in force and classified information is exchanged with the third state or international organisation concerned, the security committee may decide to modify the maximum level of euci which may be exchanged in paper form or by electronic means, in particular in the light of any follow-up assessment visit. iv. administrative arrangements 17. where a long-term need exists to exchange information classified as a general rule no higher than restreint ue/eu restricted with a third state or international organisation, and where the security committee has established that the party in question does not have a sufficiently developed security system for it to be possible to enter into a security of information agreement, the secretary-general may, subject to approval by the council, enter into an administrative arrangement on behalf of the gsc with the relevant authorities of the third state or international organisation in question. 18. where, for urgent operational reasons, a framework for exchanging classified information needs to be put in place rapidly, exceptionally the council may decide that an administrative arrangement be entered into for exchanging information of a higher classification level. 19. administrative arrangements shall as a general rule take the form of an exchange of letters. 20. an assessment visit referred to in paragraph 9 shall be conducted and the report, or in the absence of such a report the report referred to in paragraph 12, forwarded to, and deemed satisfactory by, the security committee before euci is actually released to the third state or international organisation in question. 21. no euci shall be exchanged under an administrative arrangement by electronic means unless explicitly provided for in the arrangement. v. exchange of classified information in the context of csdp operations 22. framework participation agreements govern the participation of third states or international organisations in csdp operations. such agreements shall include provisions on the release of euci generated for the purposes of csdp operations to the contributing third states or international organisations. the maximum classification level of euci which may be exchanged shall be restreint ue/eu restricted for civilian csdp operations and confidentiel ue/eu confidential for military csdp operations, unless otherwise laid down in the decision establishing each csdp operation. 23. ad hoc participation agreements concluded for a specific csdp operation shall include provisions on the release of euci generated for the purposes of that operation to the contributing third state or international organisation. the maximum classification level of euci which may be exchanged shall be restreint ue/eu restricted for civilian csdp operations and confidentiel ue/eu confidential for military csdp operations, unless otherwise laid down in the decision establishing each csdp operation. 24. in the absence of a security of information agreement and pending the conclusion of a participation agreement, the release of euci generated for the purposes of the operation to a third state or international organisation participating in the operation shall be governed by an administrative arrangement to be entered into by the high representative or subject to a decision on ad hoc release in accordance with section vi. euci shall only be exchanged under such an arrangement as long as the participation of the third state or international organisation is still envisaged. the maximum classification level of euci which may be exchanged shall be restreint ue/eu restricted for civilian csdp operations and confidentiel ue/eu confidential for military csdp operations, unless otherwise laid down in the decision establishing each csdp operation. 25. the provisions on classified information to be included in framework participation agreements, ad hoc participation agreements and ad hoc administrative arrangements referred to in paragraphs 22 to 24 shall provide that the third state or international organisation in question shall ensure that its personnel seconded to any operation will protect euci in accordance with the council\u2019s security rules and with further guidance issued by the competent authorities, including the operation\u2019s chain of command. 26. if a security of information agreement is subsequently concluded between the union and a contributing third state or international organisation, the security of information agreement shall supersede the provisions on the exchange of classified information laid down in any framework participation agreement, ad hoc participation agreement or ad hoc administrative arrangement as far as the exchange and handling of euci is concerned. 27. no exchange of euci by electronic means shall be permitted under a framework participation agreement, ad hoc participation agreement or ad hoc administrative arrangement with a third state or international organisation, unless explicitly provided for in the agreement or arrangement in question. 28. euci generated for the purposes of a csdp operation may be disclosed to personnel seconded to that operation by third states or international organisations in accordance with paragraphs 22 to 27. when authorising access to euci in premises or in cis of a csdp operation by such personnel, measures shall be applied (including recording of euci disclosed) to mitigate the risk of loss or compromise. such measures shall be defined in relevant planning or mission documents. 29. in the absence of a security of information agreement, the release of euci, in the event of a specific and immediate operational need, to the host state on whose territory a csdp operation is conducted, may be governed by an administrative arrangement to be entered into by the high representative. this possibility shall be provided for in the decision establishing the csdp operation. euci released under such circumstances shall be restricted to that generated for the purposes of the csdp operation and classified no higher than restreint ue/eu restricted, unless a higher level of classification is laid down in the decision establishing the csdp operation. under such an administrative arrangement, the host state shall be required to undertake to protect euci according to minimum standards which are no less stringent than those laid down in this decision. 30. in the absence of a security of information agreement, the release of euci to relevant third states and international organisations, other than those participating in a csdp operation, may be governed by an administrative arrangement to be entered into by the high representative. where appropriate, this possibility, as well as any conditions attached thereto, shall be provided for in the decision establishing the csdp operation. euci released under such circumstances shall be restricted to that generated for the purposes of the csdp operation and classified no higher than restreint ue/eu restricted, unless a higher level of classification is laid down in the decision establishing the csdp operation. under such an administrative arrangement, the third state or international organisation in question shall be required to undertake to protect euci according to minimum standards which are no less stringent than those laid down in this decision. 31. no implementing arrangements or assessment visits are required prior to implementing the provisions on release of euci in the context of paragraphs 22, 23 and 24. vi. exceptional ad hoc release of euci 32. where no framework is in place in accordance with sections iii to v, and where the council or one of its preparatory bodies determines the exceptional need to release euci to a third state or international organisation, the gsc shall: (a) to the extent possible, verify with the security authorities of the third state or international organisation concerned that its security regulations, structures and procedures are such that euci released to it will be protected to standards no less stringent than those laid down in this decision; and (b) invite the security committee, on the basis of available information, to issue a recommendation regarding the confidence that can be placed in the security regulations, structures and procedures in the third state or international organisation to which the euci is to be released. 33. if the security committee issues a recommendation in favour of releasing the euci, the matter shall be referred to the committee of permanent representatives (coreper), which shall take a decision on its release. 34. if the security committee\u2019s recommendation is not in favour of releasing the euci: (a) for matters relating to cfsp/csdp, the political and security committee shall discuss the matter and formulate a recommendation for a decision by coreper; (b) for all other matters, coreper shall discuss the matter and take a decision. 35. where deemed appropriate, and subject to the prior written consent of the originator, coreper may decide that the classified information may be released only in part or only if downgraded or declassified beforehand, or that the information to be released shall be prepared without reference to the source or original eu classification level. 36. following a decision to release euci, the gsc shall forward the document concerned, which shall bear a releasability marking indicating the third state or international organisation to which it has been released. prior to or upon actual release, the third party in question shall undertake in writing to protect the euci it receives in accordance with the basic principles and minimum standards set out in this decision. vii. authority to release euci to third states or international organisations 37. where a framework exists in accordance with paragraph 2 for exchanging classified information with a third state or international organisation, the council shall take a decision to authorise the secretary-general to release euci, in accordance with the principle of originator\u2019s consent, to the third state or international organisation in question. the secretary-general may delegate such authorisation to senior gsc officials. 38. where a security of information agreement exists in accordance with paragraph 2, first indent, the council may take a decision to authorise the high representative to release euci originating in the council in the area of the common foreign and security policy, after having obtained the consent of the originator of any source material contained therein, to the third state or international organisation in question. the high representative may delegate such authorisation to senior eeas officials or to eusrs. 39. where a framework exists in accordance with paragraph 2 or with paragraph 3 for exchanging classified information with a third state or international organisation, the high representative shall be authorised to release euci, in accordance with the decision establishing the csdp operation and with the principle of originator\u2019s consent. the high representative may delegate such authorisation to senior eeas officials, to eu operation, force or mission commanders, or to heads of eu mission. appendices appendix a definitions appendix b equivalence of security classifications appendix c list of national security authorities (nsas) appendix d list of abbreviations appendix a
