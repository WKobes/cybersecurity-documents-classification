regulation of the european parliament and of the council setting up a union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering, technical assistance and transit of dual -use items (recast) \u0153 outcome of the european parliament's proceedings (strasbourg, 15 to 18 january 2018) i introduction the rapporteur klaus buchner (greens/efa, de) presented a report consisting of 98 amendments (amendments 1 -98) to the proposal for a regulation (recast), which was adopted in the committee on international trade (inta) on 23 november 2017 by 34 votes to 1 with 2 abstentions. following the vote, the proposal by the rapporteur to start trilogue negotiations was rejected by inta. ii debate the debate, which took place on 16 january 2018, indicated a strong consensus among political groups and signalled the european parliament's readiness to negotiate with the council. 5360/18 fff/gj 2 dri en mr klaus buchner (greens/efa, d e), rapporteur for the inta committee, said that the eu should not contribute to human rights ' violations. he hailed the consensus reached among political groups on the key elements of the dual -use regulation as reflected in the absence of amendments prior to the vote in plenary. he called for a level playing field , clear definitions and uniform penalties for infringements across the eu. he noted that the catch -all clause for highly dangerous surveillance technology was limited enough not to disrupt legitimate export s, and open enough to close known loopholes. he pointed out that t he technical development of surveillance techno logy was extrem ely fast , and therefore believed that the limited catch -all clause and the associated european list ought to be constantly extended . he called for more transparency, including the publication of all relevant data on licenses , and for the participation of n on-governmental organizations in the legislative bodies . he defended the lifting of export controls on encryption and encourage d the commission to transfer most of the export authorizations into a general clause to reduce red tape . ms malmstr\u00f6m, commission er for trade, considered the proposal to be a true example of value -base trade. she stressed the convergence of views between the european parliament (ep) and the commission and hoped that the council would adopt its mandate soon. she welcomed the introduc tion of a human security dimension which subjected the trade in cyber -surveillance technologies to effective control and took note of the ep messages on encryption and on extra -territorial controls. she stressed the need to have legislation capable of cont inuously adjusting to a constantly changing security, technological and economic environment and rendering the system future proof. mrs marietje schaake (alde, nl ), rapporteur for the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs (afet), noted that the co mmercial market in ready -made surveillance systems remained largely unregulated. she considered this to be unacceptable and thus expressed her satisfaction with the fact that the ep had found a broad -consensus to update the dual -use regulation with targete d measures on the basis of human security. she said that surveillance systems would require a license before export, and that human rights would become a clear criterion to assess before a license was granted so that the private sector would not suffer or be hindered unnecessarily. she sought a level playing field in europe, the end of 'license shopping' and the lifting of export controls on encryption. 5360/18 fff/gj 3 dri en speakers of the epp, s&d , ecr, alde and the efdd political groups strongly supported the report . additionally, mr christofer fjellner (se) on behalf of the epp group stressed the importance of the european it sector in terms of jobs and growth thus calling for legislation that was doable and not cumbersome. mr bernd lange (de), on behalf of the s&d g roup, underlined the clear signal sent by the ep on the primacy of human rights over economic profit. mr sander loones (be), on behalf of the ecr questioned the feasibility of the proposal when it came to extraterritorial activity . both ms anne -marie min eur (gue /ngl , nl ) and ms bodil valero ( greens/efa , se ), on behalf of their respective groups, welcomed the ep strong position ahead of the interinstitutional negotiations. for the e fdd group , ms tiziana beghin (it) referred to unscrupulous companies that took advan tage of the shortcomings of the system by using 3rd countries to circumvent controls and to export to illegally occupied territories . iii vote no amendments were tabled in the run -up to the vote in plenary. when it voted on 17 january 2018, the parliament adopted the inta report with a single vote (by 571 votes to 29, with 29 abstentions). at the end of the vote, the proposal was referred back to the inta committee , pursuant to rule 59(4)(4) of the european parliament's rules of procedure, thereby not bringing the parliament's first reading to a close and opening the negotiations with the council based on the amendments adopted. 5360/18 fff/gj 4 annex
