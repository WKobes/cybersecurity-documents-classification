- add 4 subject: proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the re -use of public sector informati on (recast) - preparation for the informal trilogue i. introduction 1. the commission issued the proposal on 2 5 april 2018 as part of the most recent package of legislative initiatives aiming at the completion of the framework for the digital single market strategy (dsm) and as part of the regulatory fitness and performance (refit) program me. the march 2018 european council has set the goal to deliver the dsm until the end of the current legislative cycle. 13418/18 rb/ek 2 annex tree.2.b en 2. following the presentation of the impact assessment on 22 may 2018 by the commission, the counc il working party on telecommunication s and information society held clustered article -by-article examinations of the proposal on 12 june, 12 july, 4 september , 20 september and 4 october 2018. the tte council held a policy debate on 8 june 2018 on the directive . 3. based on the discussions in the council working party and on the written contributions from the member states, the presidency has prepared the final compromise text, attached to this document, which is a balanced proposal taking into account the key concerns of the member states. the permanent representatives committee is invited to endorse the attached document as a mandate for the presidency to star t negotiations with the parliament once it is ready for the discussions . 4. in section ii, the main changes made to the commission proposal are explained, while section iii details the changes made since the last working party document (doc. 12466/1 8). ii. changes in compar ison with the commission proposal 5. the most important changes in the text enclosed in the annex of this document as compared to the april 2018 proposal of the commission concern the following areas: a) charging : some clarifications were added in the recital s, specifying that public bodies should be able to recover costs associated with a particularly extensive search for the provision of the requested informa tion . the structure of article 6 on charging was modified to underline that , as a general rule, public sector information should be availab le for re -use for free . 13418/18 rb/ek 3 annex tree.2.b en b) high value datasets : on the free availability of high value datasets, the member states introduced an exception for libraries, museums and archives, as well as a possibility to delay implementation by up to 2 years for public sector bodies \"that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the pe rformance of their public tasks \". moreover , a large number of member states were not in favour of the choice of the instrument (delegated act) pr oposed by the commission for the establish ment of the list of high value datasets which are to be made available for free and in an automated manner. the refore, a rticle 13 and the related recitals have been changed so that such a list would be adopted by means of an implementing act. c) extension of the scope : as regards the extension of the scope to research data, member states clarified in the recitals the definition of open access and specified in more detail which data holders are concerned. as for the extension of the scope to public undertakings, some changes were made in the recitals to make it clear er in which cases public under takings will be obliged t o comply with the rules of the directive . d) apis and dynamic data : in article 5 changes were introduced to ensur e that the obligation to make dynamic data available via application programming interface s (api s) does not constitute a \"disproporti onate effort\", in particular for small public sector bodies , with criteria for the proportionality assessment further clarified in the recitals . the modifications added in article 5 also allow for \"temporary technical restrictions\" in cases where full technical compliance is not immediately possible. e) relationship with other eu legal acts : some additional modifications , both in articles and recitals, were introduced to better clarify the interplay between the psi directi ve and other eu legal acts, including the database directive, the gdpr, the inspire directive and sectoral union legislation regulating the re -use of public sector data , such as the directive on the framework for the deployment of intellige nt transport systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (its directive ). 13418/18 rb/ek 4 annex tree.2.b en 6. moreover, in line with the outcome of the policy debate in the tte council on 8 june 2018 and the overall agreement in the council working party , the notion of \"open data\" has been added to the title of the directive, which coul d in the future also be called \"open data directive\". iii. detailed changes in compar ison with the third presidency compromise (doc . 12466/18) 7. the changes in the document compared with the third presidency compromise (doc. 12466/18) are underlined : additions are marked with bold , deletions with strikethrough . additions and deletions from the first and second compromise texts are marked with bold and strikethrough (without underlining). a) changes in recital 24 have been introduced to underline that research data related to national security, defence or public security are not covered by the directive. b) the modifications in recital 32 have b een made to indicate that in certain cases marginal costs may cover the costs associated with a particularly extensive search for requested information or extremely costly modifications of the format of requested information . there is also a clarificatio n in this recital according to which public sector bodies that have made data available as open data , but are obliged to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of other public tasks , should be able to charge above marginal costs for their data. in the same recital it has been clarified that collection and production of documents may include purchasing from third parties . c) in recital 47 a description of \"anonymous information\" has been added, based on the wording used in the gdpr , and in line with the opinion of the edps on the proposal for the psi directive, issued on 10 july 2018. 13418/18 rb/ek 5 annex tree.2.b en d) in recital 54 a reference to future funding has been added, indicating that public sector bodies that enhance the quality of data while contributing to making data interoperable and available in an easy way to re -users across the union, may continue to be able to apply for support under relevant union programmes . e) article 1 (2)(g) has been modified to ensure consiste ncy with the wording from regulation (ec) no 1049/2001, in line with the opinion of the edps on the proposal for the psi directive, issued on 10 july 2018. f) in article 2(6) the word \"electronic\" has been replaced with \"digital\" in order to ensure consistency with article 2(7) . g) the modifications in article 6(5)(a) have been in troduced to ensure consistency with the new numbering in article 13 , where a separate paragraph 2a has been created with the list of exceptions to the requirement to make hi gh value datasets available for free. h) minor editorial corrections have been made in recitals 15, 16 , 18 and 31 , as well as in articles 1(6), 2(14) and 13(2a) . 13418/18 rb/ek 6 annex tree.2.b en annex 2018/0111 (cod) proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on open data and the re -use of public sector information (recast) the european parliament and the council of the european union, having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union , and in particular article 114 thereof, having regard to the proposal from the european commission, after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1, having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, whereas: 1 oj c [\u2013], [\u2013], p. [\u2013]. 2 oj c [\u2013], [\u2013], p. [\u2013]. 13418/18 rb/ek 7 annex tree.2.b en (1) directive 2003/98/ec of the european parliam ent and of the council 3 has been substantially amended. since further amendments are to be made, that directive should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) pursuant to article 13 of directive 2003/98/ec and five years after the adoption of the amending directive 2013/37/eu, the commission has, after consulting the relevant stakeholders, undertaken an evaluation and review of the functioning of the directive in the framework of a regulatory fitness and performance programme 4. (3) following the s takeholder consultation and in the light of the impact assessment 5 results, the commission considered that action at union level was necessary in order to address the remaining and emerging barriers to a wide re -use of public sector and publicly -funded inf ormation across the union and to bring the legislative framework up to date with the advances in digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things. (4) the substantive changes introduced to the legal text so as to fully exp loit the potential of public sector information for the european economy and society focus on the following areas: the provision of real -time access to dynamic data via adequate technical means, increasing the supply of high -value public data for re -use, i ncluding from public undertakings, research performing organisations and research funding organisations, tackling the emergence of new forms of exclusive arrangements, the use of exceptions to the principle of charging the marginal cost and the relationshi p between this directive and certain related legal instruments, including directive 96/9/ec 6 and directive 2007/2/ec of the european parliament and of the council 7. 3 directive 2003/98/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 17 november 2003 on the re -use of public sector information (oj l 345, 31.12.2003, p. 90). 4 swd(2018) 145. 5 swd(2018) 127. 6 directive 96/9/ec of the european parliament and of the cou ncil of 11 march 1996 on the legal protection of databases (oj l 77, 27.3.1996, p. 20). 7 directive 2007/2/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 14 march 2007 establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the european community (inspire) (oj l 108, 25.4.2007, p.1). 13418/18 rb/ek 8 annex tree.2.b en (5) the treaty provides for the establishment of an internal market and of a system ensuring that competition in the internal market is not distorted. harmonisation of the rules and practices in the member states relating to the exploitation of public sector information contributes to the achievement of these objectives. (6) the public sector in the member states collects, produces, reproduces and disseminates a wide range of information in many areas of activity, such as social, economic, geographical, weather, tourist, business, patent and educational information. documents produced by public sector bodies of executive, legislative or judicial nature constitute a vast, diverse and valuable pool of resources that can benefit the knowledge economy. (7) directive 2003/98/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 17 november 20 03 on the re -use of public sector information established a minimum set of rules governing the re-use and the practical means of facilitating re -use of existing documents held by public sector bodies of the member states, including executive, legislative a nd judicial bodies. since the adoption of the first set of rules on re -use of public sector information, the amount of data in the world, including public data, has increased exponentially and new types of data are being generated and collected. in paralle l, we are witnessing a continuous evolution in technologies for analysis, exploitation and processing of data. this rapid technological evolution makes it possible to create new services and new applications, which are built upon the use, aggregation or co mbination of data. the rules originally adopted in 2003 and later amended in 2013 no longer keep pace with these rapid changes and as a result the economic and social opportunities offered by re -use of public data risk being missed. (8) the evolution towa rds a data -based society influences the life of every citizen in the community union , among other things , by enabling them to gain new ways of accessing and acquiring knowledge. (9) digital content plays an important role in this evolution. content produ ction has given rise to rapid job creation in recent years and continues to do so. most of these jobs are created by innovative start -ups and small - and medium sized enterprises (smes ). 13418/18 rb/ek 9 annex tree.2.b en (10) one of the principal aims of the establishment of an internal ma rket is the creation of conditions conducive to the development of union -wide services. public sector information is an important primary material for digital content products and services and will become an even more important content resource with the de velopment of wireless content services. broad cross -border geographical coverage will also be essential in this context. wide possibilities of re -using public sector information should inter alia allow european companies to exploit its potential and contri bute to economic growth and job creation. (11) allowing re -use of documents held by a public sector body adds value for the re -users, for the end users and for society in general and in many cases for the public body itself, by promoting transparency and accountability and providing feedback from re -users and end users which allows the public sector body concerned to improve the quality of the information collected. (12) there are considerable differences in the rules and practices in the member states re lating to the exploitation of public sector information resources, which constitute barriers to bringing out the full economic potential of this key document resource. practice in public sector bodies in exploiting public sector information continues to vary among member states. that should be taken into account. minimum harmonisation of national rules and practices on the re-use of public sector documents should therefor e be undertaken, in cases where the differences in national regulations and practices or the absence of clarity hinder the smooth functioning of the internal market and the proper development of the information society in the community union . (13) open da ta as a general concept refers to data in open formats that can ideally be freely used, re -used , modified and shared by anyone for any purpose. open data policies which encourage the wide availability and re -use of public sector information for private or commercial purposes, with minimal or no legal, technical or financial constraints, and which promote the circulation of information not only for economic operators but also for the public, can play an important role in kick -starting the development of new services based on novel ways to combine and make use of such information, stimulate economic growth and promote social engagement. 13418/18 rb/ek 10 annex tree.2.b en (14) moreover, without minimum harmonisation at community union level, legislative activities at national level, which have already been initiated in a number of member states in order to respond to the technological challenges, might result in even more significant differences. the impact of such legislative differences and uncertainties will become more significant with the further development of the information society, which has already greatly increased cross -border exploitation of information. (15) member states have established re -use policies under directive 2003/98/ec and some of them have been adopting ambitious open data approaches to make re -use of accessible public data easier for citizens and companies beyond the minimum level set by that directive. to prevent different diverging rules in different member states may acting as a barrier to the cross -border offer of products and services , and to enable prevent comparable public data sets to from being re-usable for pan -european applications based on them . hence , a minimum harmonisation is required to determine what public data are available for re-use in the internal information market, consistent with and not affecting the relevant access regime s, both general and sectoral, such as the one defined by directive 2003/4/ec of the european parliament and of the council on public access to environmental informatio n8. the provisions of union and national law that go beyond these minimum requirements, notably in cases of sectoral legislation, should continue to apply. examples of provisions that exceed the minimum harmonisation level of this directive include lower t hresholds for permissible charges for re -use than the thresholds foreseen in article 6 or less restrictive licensing terms than those referred to in article 8. notably, this directive should be without prejudice to provisions that exceed the minimum harmon isation level of this directive as laid down in commission delegated regulations adopted under directive 2010/40/eu of the european parliament and of the council on the framework for the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road tran sport and for interfaces with other modes of transport. 8 directive 2003/4/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 28 january 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing council directive 90/313/eec ( oj l 41, 14.2.2003, p. 26 \u015332). 13418/18 rb/ek 11 annex tree.2.b en (16) a general framework for the conditions governing re -use of public sector documents is needed in order to ensure fair, proportionate and non -discriminatory conditions for the re -use of such in formation. public sector bodies collect, produce, reproduce and disseminate documents to fulfil their public tasks. use of such documents for other reasons constitutes a re-use. member states' policies can go beyond the minimum standards established in thi s directive, thus allowing for more extensive re -use. in their national legislation when transposing this directive, member states can use other terms than 'documents', as long as the full scope of what is covered by the definition of the term 'document' in article 2 this directive is maintained. (17) this directive should apply to documents the supply of which forms part of the public tasks of the public sector bodies concerned, as defined by law or by other binding rules in the member states. in the absence of such rules the public tasks should be defined in accordance with common administrative practice in the member states, provided that the scope of the public tasks is transparent and subject to review. the public tasks could be defined generally o r on a case -by-case basis for individual public sector bodies. (18) this directive should apply to documents that are made accessible for re -use when public sector bodies license, sell, disseminate, exchange or give out information. to avoid cross -subsidi es, re -use should include further use of documents within the organisation itself for activities falling outside the scope of its public tasks. activities falling outside the public task will typically include supply of documents that are produced and char ged for exclusively on a commercial basis and in competition with others in the market. 13418/18 rb/ek 12 annex tree.2.b en (19) the directive lays down an obligation for member states to make all existing documents re-usable unless access is restricted or excluded under national rules on access to documents or and subject to the other exceptions laid down in this directive. the directive builds on the existing access regimes in the member states and does no t change the national rules for access to documents. it does not apply in cases in which citizens or companies can, under the relevant access regime, only obtain a document if they can prove a particular interest. at union level, articles 41 ( rright to goo d administration) and 42 (right of access to documents) of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union recognise the right of any citizen of the union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a member state to have access to european parliament, council and commission documents. public sector bodies should be encouraged to make available for re-use any documents held by them. public sector bodies should promote and encourage re -use of documents, including offic ial texts of a legislative and administrative nature in those cases where the public sector body has the right to authorise their re -use. (20) the member states often entrust the provision of services in the general interest with entities outside of the p ublic sector while maintaining a high degree of control over such entities. at the same time, the provisions of the directive 2003/98/ec apply only to documents held by public sector bodies, while excluding public undertakings from its scope. this leads to a poor availability for re -use of documents produced in the performance of services in the general interest in a number of areas, notably in the utility sectors. it also greatly reduces the potential for the creation of cross -border services based on docu ments held by public undertakings that provide services in the general interest. 13418/18 rb/ek 13 annex tree.2.b en (21) directive 2003/98/ec should therefore be amended in order to ensure that its provisions can be applied to the re -use of existing documents produced in the performance o f services in the general interest by public undertakings pursuing one of the activities referred to in articles 8 to 14 of directive 2014/25/eu of the european parliament and of the council 9, as well as by public undertakings acting as public service oper ators pursuant to article 2 of regulation (ec) no 1370/2007 of the european parliament and the council on public passenger transport services by rail and by road, public undertakings acting as air carriers fulfilling public service obligations pursuant to article 16 of regulation (ec) no 1008/2008 of the european parliament and of the council of 24 september 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the community, and public undertakings acting as community shipowners fulfilling public servi ce obligations pursuant to article 4 of regulation (eec) no 3577/92 of 7 december 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide sevices to maritime transport within member states (maritime cabotage). 9 directive 2014/25/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 26 february 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repealing directive 2004/17/ec (oj l 94, 28.3.2014, p. 243). 13418/18 rb/ek 14 annex tree.2.b en (22) this directive should not contain a n general obligation to allow the re -use of documents produced by public undertakings and should be without prejudice, in that respect, to national law . the decision whether or not to authorise re -use should remain with the public undertaking concerned , except where otherwise required by in accordance with this directive, union or national law . only after the public undertaking has chosen to madke a document available for re -use, should it observe the relevant obligations laid down in chapters iii , and iv and v of this directive, in particular as regards formats, charging, transparency, licences, non -discrimation and prohibition of exclusive arrangements. on the other hand, the public undertaking s are is not required to comply with the requirements laid down in c hapter ii, such as the rules applicable to processing of requests. when allowing the re-use of documents, particular attention should be given to the protection of critical infrastructure defined in accordance with directive 2008/114 /ec 10 and of essential services defined in accordance with directive (eu ) 2016/1148 11. 10 council direc tive 2008/114/ec of 8 december 2008 on the identification and designation of european critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection (oj l 345, 23.12.2008, p. 75). 11 directive (eu) 2016/1148 of the european parliament and of the council of 6 july 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the union (the nis directive). 13418/18 rb/ek 15 annex tree.2.b en (23) the volume of research data generated is growing exponentially and has potential for re -use beyond the scientific community. in order to be able to address mounting societal challenges efficiently and in a holistic manner, it has become crucial and urgent to be able to access, blend and re -use data from different sources, as well as across sectors and disciplines. research data includes statistics, results of experiments, measurements, obs ervations resulting from fieldwork, survey results, interview recordings and images. it also includes meta -data, specifications and other digital objects. research data is different from scientific articles reporting and commenting on findings resulting fr om their scientific research. for many years, the open availability and re -usability of scientific research results stemming from public funding has been subject to specific policy initiatives. open access is understood as the practice of providing online access to research outputs free of charge for the end user and without restrictions on use and re -use beyond the possibility to require authorship to be acknowledged. open access policies aim in particular to provide researchers and the public at large wit h access to research data as early as possible in the dissemination process and to enable facilitate its use and re -use. open access helps enhance quality, reduce the need for unnecessary duplication of research, speed up scientific progress, combat scient ific fraud, and it can overall favour economic growth and innovation. beside open access, efforts are currently being made to ensure that data management planning becomes a standard scientific practice and to support the dissemination of research data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and re -usable (fair principles). data management planning is swiftly becoming a standard scientific practice for ensuring data that is findable, accessible, interoperable and re -usable (fair principles). 13418/18 rb/ek 16 annex tree.2.b en (24) for the reasons explained above, it is appropriate to set an obligation on member states to adopt open access policies with respect to publicly -funded research results data and ensure that such policies are implemented by all research performing organisati ons and research funding organisations. open access policies typically allow for a range of exceptions from making scientific research results openly available. on 17 july 2012, the commission adopted a recommendation on access to and preservation of scien tific information, updated on 25 april 2018 12, and describing, among other things, relevant elements of open access policies. additionally, the conditions, under which certain research results can be re -used, should be improved. for this reason, certain obl igations stemming from this directive should be extended to research data resulting from scientific research activities subsidised by public funding or co -funded by public and private -sector entities. however, in this context, concerns in relation to priva cy, protection of personal data, confidentiality, trade secrets, national security, legitimate commercial interests , such as trade secrets, and to intellectual property rights of third parties should be duly taken into account , according to the principle \u201a as open as possible, as closed as necessary\u2122 . moreover, r esearch data which are excluded from access on the grounds of national security, defence or public security should not be covered by this directive . in order to avoid any administrative burden, such obligations stemming from this directive should only apply to such research data that have already been made publicly available by researchers, research performing organisations or research funding organisations through an institutional or subject -based r epository by researchers through an institutional or subject -based repository . and should not impose extra costs for the retrieval of the datasets or require additional curation of data. member states may extend the application of the directive to research data made publicly available through open access publications, as an attached file to an article, a data paper or a paper in a data journal. documents oother than research data types of documents held by research performing organisations and research fund ing organisations should continue to be exempt from the scope of application of this directive. 12 c(2018)2375 . 13418/18 rb/ek 17 annex tree.2.b en (25) the definitions of \u201apublic sector body\u2122 and \u201abody governed by public law\u2122 are taken from directive 2014/24/eu of the european parliament and the council 13. the definition of 'public undertaking' is taken from directive 2014/25/eu of the european parliament and the council 14. (26) this directive lays down a generic definition of the term \u201adocument\u2122. it covers any representation of acts, facts or information \u0161 and any compilation of such acts, facts or information \u0161 whatever its medium (written on paper, or stored in electronic form or as a sound, visual or audiovisual recording). the definition of \u201adocument\u2122 is not intended to cover computer programmes. memb er states may extend the application of this directive to computer programmes. (27) public sector bodies are increasingly making their documents available for re -use in a proactive manner, by ensuring online discoverability and actual availability of documents and associated both metadata and the underlying content . documents should also be made available for re -use following a request lodged by a re -user. in those cases, the time limit for replying to requests for re -use should be reasonable and in ac cordance with the equivalent time for requests to access the document under the relevant access regimes. public undertakings, educational establishments, research performing organisations and research funding organisations should however be exempt from thi s requirement. reasonable time limits throughout the union will stimulate the creation of new aggregated information products and services at pan -european level. this is particularly important for dynamic data (including traffic data, satellite data, weath er data , sensor generated data ), the economic value of which depends on the immediate availability of the information and of regular updates. dynamic data should therefore be made available immediately after collection, or in case of a manual update immedi ately after the modification of the dataset , via an application programming interface so as to facilitate the development of internet, mobile and cloud applications based on such data. whenever this is not possible due to technical or 13 directive 2014/24/eu of the european parliament and the council of 26 februa ry 2014 on public procurement (oj l 94, 28.3.2014, p. 65). 14 directive 2014/25/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 26 february 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repeal ing directive 2004/17/ec (oj l 94, 28.3.2014, p. 243). 13418/18 rb/ek 18 annex tree.2.b en financial constraints , public sector bodies should make the documents available in a timeframe that allows their full economic potential to be exploited. should a licence be used, the timely availability of documents may be a part of the terms of the licence. where data verifi cation is essential in the light of justified public interest reasons, notably for public health and safety, dynamic data should be made available immediately after verification. such essential verification should not affect the frequency of the updates. (28) in order to get access to the data opened for re -use by this directive, the use of suitable and well -designed application programming interfaces (apis) is needed useful . an api means a set of functions, procedures, definitions and protocols for machin e-to-machine communication and the seamless exchange of dynamic data. apis are normally should be supported by clear technical documentation that is complete and available online. where possible, open apis should be used. european or internationally recognised standard protocols should be applied and international standards for datasets should be used where applicable . describes the kind of data can be retrieved, how to do this and the format in which the data will be recei ved. apis can have different levels of complexity and can mean a simple link to a database to retrieve specific datasets, a web interface, or more complex set -ups. there is general value in re -using and sharing data via a suitable use of apis as this will help developers and start -ups to create new services and products. it is also a crucial ingredient of creating valuable ecosystems around data assets that are often unused. the set -up and use of api needs to be based on several principles: availability, stability, maintenance over lifecycle, uniformity of use and standards, user -friendliness as well as security. for dynamic data, meaning frequently updated data, often in real time, public sector bodies and public undertakings shall should make this availabl e for re -use immediately after collection by ways of suitable apis and, where relevant, as a bulk download of the complete dataset , save for cases where this would impose a disproportionate effort. assessment of the proportionality of the effort should tak e into account the size and operating budget of the public sector body or the public undertaking in question. european or internationally recognised standard protocols should be applied. 13418/18 rb/ek 19 annex tree.2.b en (29) the possibilities for re -use can be improved by limiting the need to digitise paper -based documents or to process digital files to make them mutually compatible. therefore, public sector bodies should make documents available in any pre -existing format or language, through electronic means where possible and appropr iate. public sector bodies should view requests for extracts from existing documents favourably when to grant such a request would involve only a simple operation. public sector bodies should not, however, be obliged to provide an extract from a document or to modify the format of the requested information where this involves disproportionate effort. to facilitate re -use, public sector bodies should make their own documents available in a format which, as far as possible and appropriate, is not dependent on the use of specific software. where possible and appropriate, public sector bodies should take into account the possibilities for the re -use of documents by and for persons with disabilities by providing the information in accessible formats in accordance with the requirements of the web accessibility directive 15. (30) to facilitate re -use, public sector bodies should, where possible and appropriate, make documents, including those published on websites, available through open and machine -readable formats and together with their metadata, at the best level of precision and granularity, in a format that ensures interoperability, e.g. by processing them in a way consistent with the principles governing the compatibility and usability requirements for spatial information under directive 2007/2/ec of the european parliament and of the council. 16 15 directive (eu) 2016/2102 of the european parliament and of the council of 26 october 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies (oj l 327, 2.12.2016, p. 1). 16 directive 2007/2/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 14 march 2007 establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the european community (inspire) (oj l 108, 25.4.2007, p.1). 13418/18 rb/ek 20 annex tree.2.b en (31) a document should be considered to be in a machine -readable format if it is in a file format that is structured in such a way that software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific data from it. data encoded in files that are struct ured in a machine -readable format should be considered to be machine -readable data. machine -readable formats can be open or proprietary; they can be formal standards or not. documents encoded in a file format that limits automatic processing, because the d ata cannot, or cannot easily, be extracted from them, should not be considered to be in a machine -readable format. member states should where possible and appropriate encourage the use of european or internationally recognised open, machine -readable format s. the european interoperability solutions framework should be taken into account , where applicable , when designing technical solutions for the re -use of documents. (32) charges for the re -use of documents constitute an important market entry barrier for start -ups and smes. documents should therefore be made available for re -use without charges and, where charges are necessary they should in principle be limited to the marginal costs . where public bodies carry out a particularly extensive search for reques ted information or extremely costly modifications of the format of requested information, either voluntarily or as required under national law, marginal costs may cover the costs associated with such activities . , which marginal costs may cover the costs a ssociated with a particularly extensive search for the provision of the requested information or extremely costly modifications of the format of requested information . in exceptional cases, the necessity of not hindering the normal running of public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks should be taken into consideration. this also applies where a public sector body has made data available as ope n data but is obliged to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the perfomance of other public tasks . the role of public undertakings in a competitive economic environment should also be acknowledged. in such cases, public sector bodies and public undertakings should therefore be able to charge above marginal costs. those charges should be set according to objective, transparent and verifiable criteria and the total income from supplying and allowing re -use of documents shou ld not exceed the cost of collection and , production, including purchasing from third parties, reproduction and dissemination, together with a reasonable return on investment. where applicable, the costs of anonymisation of personal data or of commercially sensitive information should also be included in the eligible cost. the requirement to generate revenue 13418/18 rb/ek 21 annex tree.2.b en to cover a substantial part of the public sector bodies\u2122 costs relating to the performance of their public tasks or the scope of the services of genera l interest entrusted with public undertakings does not have to be a legal requirement and may stem, for example, from administrative practices in member states. such a requirement should be regularl y reviewed by the member states. (33) libraries, museums and archives should also be able to charge above marginal costs in order not to hinder their normal running. in the case of such public sector bodies the total income from supplying and allowing re -use of documents over the appropriate accounting period should not exceed the cost of collection, production, reproduction, dissemination, preservation and rights clearance, together with a reasonable return on investment. where applicable, the costs of anonymisation of personal data or of commercially sensitive information should also be included in the eligible cost. for the purpose of libraries, museums and archives and bearing in mind their particularities, the prices charged by the private sector for the re -use of identical or similar documents could be consi dered when calculating a reasonable return on investment. (34) the upper limits for charges set in this directive are without prejudice to the right of member states to apply lower charges or no charges at all. (35) member states should lay down the crit eria for charging above marginal costs. in this respect, member states, for example, may lay down such criteria in national rules or may designate the appropriate body or appropriate bodies, other than the public sector body itself, competent to lay down s uch criteria. that body should be organised in accordance with the constitutional and legal systems of the member states. it could be an existing body with budgetary executive powers and under political responsibility. 13418/18 rb/ek 22 annex tree.2.b en (36) ensuring that the conditions f or re -use of public sector documents are clear and publicly available is a pre -condition for the development of a union -wide information market. therefore all applicable conditions for the re -use of the documents should be made clear to the potential re -users. member states should encourage the creation of indices accessible on line, where appropriate, of available documents so as to promote and facilitate requests for re-use. applicants for re -use of documents held by entities other than public undertaking s, educational establishments, research performing organisations and research funding organisations should be informed of available means of redress relating to decisions or practices affecting them. this will be particularly important for smes which may n ot be familiar with interactions with public sector bodies from other member states and corresponding means of redress. (37) the means of redress should include the possibility of review by an impartial review body. that body could be an already existing national authority, such as the national competition authority, the national access to documents authority or a national judicial authority. that body should be organised in accordance with the constitutional and legal systems of member states and should n ot prejudge any means of redress otherwise available to applicants for re -use. it should however be distinct from the member state mechanism laying down the criteria for charging above marginal costs. the means of redress should include the possibility of review of negative decisions but also of decisions which, although permitting re -use, could still affect applicants on other grounds, notably by the charging rules applied. the review process should be swift, in accordance with the needs of a rapidly chang ing market. (38) making public all generally available documents held by the public sector \u0161 concerning not only the political process but also the legal and administrative process \u0161 is a fundamental instrument for extending the right to knowledge, which is a basic principle of democracy. this objective is applicable to institutions at every level, be it local, national or international. 13418/18 rb/ek 23 annex tree.2.b en (39) in some cases the re -use of documents will take place without a licence being agreed. in other cases a licence will be issued imposing conditions on the re -use by the licensee dealing with issues such as liability, the proper use of documents, guaranteeing non -alteration and the acknowledgement of source. if public sector bodies license documents for re -use, the licence conditions should be fair and transparent. standard licences that are available online may also play an important role in this respect. therefore member states should provide for the availability of standard licences. (40) if the competent authority decides to no longer make available certain documents for re -use, or to cease updating these documents, it should make these decisions publicly known, at the earliest opportunity, via electronic means whenever possible. (41) conditions for re -use should be non -discriminatory for comparable categories of re -use. this should, for example, not prevent the exchange of information between public sector bodies free of charge for the exercise of public tasks, whilst other parties are charged for the re-use of th e same documents. neither should it prevent the adoption of a differentiated charging policy for commercial and non -commercial re -use. 13418/18 rb/ek 24 annex tree.2.b en (42) in relation to any re -use that is made of the document, public sector bodies may impose conditions, where appropria te through a licence, such as acknowledgment of source and acknowledgment of whether the document has been modified by the re -user in any way. any licences for the re -use of public sector information should in any event place as few restrictions on re -use as possible, for example limiting them to an indication of source. open licences available online, which grant wider re -use rights without technological, financial or geographical limitations and relying on open data formats, should play an important role in this respect. therefore, member states should encourage the use of open licences that should eventually become common practice across the union. (43) public sector bodies should respect competition rules when establishing the principles for re -use of d ocuments avoiding as far as possible exclusive agreements between themselves and private partners. however, in order to provide a service of general economic interest, an exclusive right to re -use specific public sector documents may sometimes be necessary . this may be the case if no commercial publisher would publish the information without such an exclusive right. 13418/18 rb/ek 25 annex tree.2.b en (44) there are numerous cooperation arrangements between libraries, including university libraries, museums, archives and private partners wh ich involve digitisation of cultural resources granting exclusive rights to private partners. practice has shown that such public -private partnerships can facilitate worthwhile use of cultural collections and at the same time accelerate access to the cultu ral heritage for members of the public. it is therefore appropriate to take into account current divergences in the member states with regard to digitisation of cultural resources, by a specific set of rules pertaining to agreements on digitisation of such resources. where an exclusive right relates to digitisation of cultural resources, a certain period of exclusivity might be necessary in order to give the private partner the possibility to recoup its investment. that period should, however, be limited in time and as short as possible, in order to respect the principle that public domain material should stay in the public domain once it is digitised. the period of an exclusive right to digitise cultural resources should in general not exceed 10 years. any period of exclusivity longer than 10 years should be subject to review, taking into account technological, financial and administrative changes in the environment since the arrangement was entered into. in addition, any public private partnership for the d igitisation of cultural resources should grant the partner cultural institution full rights with respect to the post -termination use of digitised cultural resources. 13418/18 rb/ek 26 annex tree.2.b en (45) arrangements between data holders and data re -users which do not expressly grant exc lusive rights but which can reasonably be expected to restrict the availability of documents for re -use should be subject to additional public scrutiny . therefore, the essential aspects of such arrangements and should therefore be published online at least two months before coming into effect , i.e. two months before the agreed date on which the performance of the obligations of the parties is set to begin. the publication should so as to give interested parties an opportunity to request the re -use of the do cuments covered by the arrangement agreement and prevent the risk of restricting the range of potential re -users. in any event, the essential aspects of such arrangements in their final form agreed by the parties such agreements should also be made public online without undue delay following their conclusion , in the final form agreed by the parties . (46) this directive aims at minimising the risk of excessive first -mover advantage that could limit the number of potential re -users of the data. where contra ctual arrangements may, in addition to the member state's obligations under this directive to grant documents, entail a transfer of member state's resources within the meaning of article 107(1) tfeu, this directive should be without prejudice to the applic ation of the state aid and other competition rules laid down in articles 101 to 109 of the treaty. it follows from the state aid rules laid down in articles 107 to 109 of the treaty that the state must verify ex ante whether state aid may be involved in th e relevant contractual arrangement and ensure that they comply with state aid rules. 13418/18 rb/ek 27 annex tree.2.b en (47) this directive is without prejudice and should not affect the level of be implemented and applied in full compliance with union law relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under the provisions of union and national law, particularly under including regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council 17 and directive 2002/58/ec of the european parliam ent and of the council 18. the national law should be understood as , and including any supplementing and reconciling provisions of law enacted by the member states within the flexibility allowed by the regulation . anonymisation anonymous information is infor mation which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. rendering information anonymous is a means to reconcile the interests in making public sector information as re -usable as possible with the obligations under data protection legislation, but comes at a cost. it is appropriate to consider this cost as one of the cost items to be considered as part of the marginal co st of dissemination as defined in article 6 of this directive. 17 regulation (eu) 2016/679 of the european pa rliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing directive 95/46/ec (general data protection regulation) [\u2013]. 18 directive 2 002/58/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 12 july 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (directive on privacy and electronic communications) (oj l 201 , 31/07/ 2002 p. 37). 13418/18 rb/ek 28 annex tree.2.b en (48) the intellectual property rights of third parties are not affected by this directive. for the avoidance of doubt, the term \u201aintellectual property rights\u2122 refers to copyright and related rights only (including sui generis forms of protection). this directive does not apply to documents covered by industrial property rights, such as patents, registered designs and trademarks. the directive does not affect the existence or ownership of inte llectual property rights of public sector bodies, nor does it limit the exercise of these rights in any way beyond the boundaries set by this directive. the obligations imposed by in accordance with this directive should apply only insofar as they are comp atible with the provisions of international agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights, in particular the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works (the berne convention) , the agreement on trade -related aspects of intellectual property rights (the trips agreement) and the wipo copyright treaty (wct) . public sector bodies should, however, exercise their copyright in a way that facilitates re -use. (49) taking into account union law and the international obligations of member states and of the union, particularly under the berne convention and the trips agreement, documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights should be excluded from the scope of this directive. if a third party was the initial ow ner of the intellectual property rights for a document held by libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives and the term of protection of those rights has not expired, that document should, for the purpose of this directive, be considere d as a document for which third parties hold intellectual property rights. (50) this directive should be without prejudice to the rights, including economic and moral rights that employees of public sector bodies may enjoy under national rules. (51) more over, where any document is made available for re -use, the public sector body concerned should retain the right to exploit the document. 13418/18 rb/ek 29 annex tree.2.b en (52) tools that help potential re -users to find documents available for re -use and the conditions for re -use can faci litate considerably the cross -border use of public sector documents. member states should therefore ensure that practical arrangements are in place that help re -users in their search for documents available for re -use. assets lists, accessible preferably online, of main documents (documents that are extensively re -used or that have the potential to be extensively re -used), and portal sites that are linked to decentralised assets lists are examples of such practical arrangements. (53) this directive is with out prejudice to directive 2001/29/ec of the european parliament and of the council and directive 96/9/ec of the european parliament and of the council 19. it spells out the conditions within which public sector bodies can exercise their intellectual property rights in the internal information market when allowing re -use of documents. in particular, w where public sector bodies are holders of the right provided for in article 7(1) of directive 96/9/ec, they should not exercise it that right in order to prevent re-use or to restrict the re -use of data contained in databases existing documents beyond the limits set regulated by this directive . 19 directive 96/9/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 11 march 1996 on the legal protection of databases (oj l 77, 27.3.1996, p. 20 ). 13418/18 rb/ek 30 annex tree.2.b en (54) the commission has supported the development of an online open data maturity report with relevant performance indicators for the re -use of public sector information in all the member states. a regular update of this report will contribute to the exchange of information between the member states and the availability of information on policies and practi ces across the union. in addit ion, public sector bodies that enhance the quality of data while contribut ing to making data interoperable and available in an easy way to re-users across the union, may continue to be able to apply for support under relevant union programmes. (55) it is necessary to ensure that the member states monitor the extent of the re -use of public sector information, the conditions under which it is made available and the redress practices. (56) the commission may assist the member st ates in implementing this directive in a consistent way by issuing and updating existing guidelines, particularly on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re -use of documents, after consulting interested parties. (57) one of the principal aims of the establishment of the internal market is the creation of conditions conducive to the development of union -wide services. libraries, museums and archives hold a significant amount of valuable public sector information resources, in part icular since digitisation projects have multiplied the amount of digital public domain material. these cultural heritage collections and related metadata are a potential base for digital content products and services and have a huge potential for innovativ e re -use in sectors such as learning and tourism. other types of cultural establishments (such as orchestras, operas, ballets and theatres), including the archives that are part of those establishments, should remain outside the scope because of their \u201aper forming arts\u2122 specificity and the fact that almost all of their material is subject to third -party intellectual property rights and would therefore remain outside the scope of that directive. 13418/18 rb/ek 31 annex tree.2.b en (58) an eu -wide list of types of datasets with a particular pot ential to generate socio -economic benefits together with harmonised re -use conditions constitutes an important enabler of cross -border data applications and services. in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this directive, implement ing powers should be conferred on the commission to set in place conditions support ing the re -use of documents which is associated with important socio -economic benefits having a particular high value for economy and society, the power to adopt acts in acc ordance with article 290291 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in respect of the by adopting on of a list of specific types of high -value datasets among the documents to which specific requirements o f this directive appl yies , along with the modalities of their publication and re -use . the list should take into account sectoral union legislation that already regulates the publication of datasets, as well as the categories indicated in the technical anne x of the g8 open data charter and in the commission's notice 2014 /c 240/01. in preparing the list, the commission should carry out appropriate consultations, including at expert level. moreover, when deciding on the inclusion in the list of data held by p ublic undertakings or on their free availability, the effects on competition in the respective markets should be taken into account. the implementing acts should take into account sectoral union legislation, such as directive 2007/2/ec 20 and directive 2010/ 40/eu 21, to ensure that datasets are made available under corresponding standards and sets of metadata. it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement of 13 april 2016 on better law -making. in particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the european parliame nt and the council receive all documents at the same time as member states' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. 20 directive 2007/2/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 14 march 2007 establis hing an infrastructure for spatial information in the european community (inspire) (oj l 108, 25.4.2007, p.1). 21 directive 2010/40/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 7 july 2010 on the framework for the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (oj l 207, 6.8.2010, p. 1). 13418/18 rb/ek 32 annex tree.2.b en those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council. (59) in the process leading to the establishment of the list, the commission should carry out appropriate consultations, including at expert level. the list should take into account sectoral legislation that already regulates the publication of datasets, as well as the categories indicated in the technical annex of the g8 open data charter and in the commission's notice 2014 /c 240/01. (60) in view of ensuring their maximum impact and to facilitate re -use, the high -value datasets should be made available for re -use with minimal legal restrictions and at no cost. they should also be published via application programming interfaces , whenever the dataset in question con tains dynamic data . however, this does not preclude public sector bodies from charging for services that they provide in relation to the high value datasets in their exercise of public authority, in particular certifying the authenticity or veracity of doc uments. (61) since the objectives of this directive, namely to facilitate the creation of union -wide information products and services based on public sector documents, to ensure the effective cross -border use of public sector documents on the one hand by private companies, particularly by small and medium -sized enterprises, for added -value information products and services, and on the other hand by citizens to facilitate the free circulation of information and communication, cannot be sufficiently achieve d by the member states but can rather , by reasons of the pan -european scope of the proposed action, be better achieved at union level, the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on eu ropean union. in accordance with the principle s of proportionality as set out in that article, this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. 13418/18 rb/ek 33 annex tree.2.b en (62) this directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the charter of fundamental rights of the european union, including the right to privacy (article 7), the protection of personal data (article 8) the right to property (article 17) and the integration of persons with d isabilities (article 26). nothing in this directive should be interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. (63) the commission should carry out an evaluation of this directive. pursuant to paragraph 22 of the interinstitutional agreement between the european parliament, the council of the european union and the european commission on better law -making of 13 april 2016 22, that evaluation should be base d on the five criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and eu value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of possible further measures. (64) the obligation to transpose this directive into national law should be conf ined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier directives. the obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier directives . (65) this directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the member states relating to the time -limit for the transposition into national law of the directives set out in annex i, part b , have adopted this directive: 22 oj l123, 12.5. 2016, p1. 13418/18 rb/ek 34 annex tree.2.b en chapter i general provisions article 1 subject matter and scope 1. this directive establishes a minimum set of rules governing the re -use and the practical means of facilitating re -use of : (a) existing documents held by public sector bodies of the member states : (b) existing documents held by public undertakings active in the areas defined in directive 2014/25/eu of the european parliament and of the council 23 and by public undertakings acting as public service operators pursuant to article 2 of regulation (ec) no 1370/2007 of the european parliament and of the council 24, public undertakings acting as air carriers fulfilling public service obligations pursuant to article 16 of regulation (ec) no 1008/2008 of the european parliament and of the council 25, and public undertakings acting as community shipowners fulfilling public servi ce obligations pursuant to article 4 of council regulation (eec) no 3577/92 26.
