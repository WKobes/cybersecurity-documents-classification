(2) in addition, third -country aircraft operated into, within or out of the territory where the relev ant provisions of the treaty on european union ('teu') and the treaty on the functioning of the european union ('tfeu') apply (the 'treaties'), should be subject to appropriate oversight at union level within the limits set by the convention on internation al civil aviation, signed in chicago on 7 december 1944 (the 'chicago convention'), to which all member states are parties. (3) it would not be appropriate to subject all aircraft to common rules. in particular, in light of their limited risk to civil avia tion safety, aircraft that are of simple design or operate mainly on a local basis and those which are home -built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number should remain under the regulatory control of the member states, without any obligation u nder this regulation on other member states to recognise such national arrangements. (4) however, the possibility should be provided to apply certain provisions under this regulation to certain types of aircraft which are excluded from the provisions of t his regulation, especially those which are produced in an industrial manner and which could draw benefits from free circulation within the union. therefore, organisations involved in the design of such aircraft should be allowed to request the commission t o decide that union requirements regarding design, manufacture and maintenance of aircraft apply to new types of aircraft which are to be put on the market by such organisations. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 4 annex dge 2a en (4a) this regulation should provide for a number of new tools that should su pport the implementation of simple and proportionate rules for sport and recreational aviation. the measures taken in accordance with this regulation to regulate this segment of aviation should be proportionate, flexible and based on existing best practice s in the member states. these measures should b e developed in a timely manner. (5) it would not be appropriate to subject all aerodromes to common rules. aerodromes which are not open to public use or aerodromes which do not serve commercial air transport or aerodromes without paved instrument runways of more than 800 metres should remain under the regulatory control of the member states, without any obligation under this regulation on other member states to recognise such nat ional arrangements. (6) member states should be allowed to exempt from the provisions of this regulation aerodromes with low volumes of traffic, provided that the aerodromes concerned nevertheless meet the minimum common safety objectives laid down in the relevant essential requirements. when a member state grants such exemptions, those exemptions should also apply to the equipment used at the aerodrome concerned and to the providers of ground handling and apron management services operating at the exempted aerodromes. exemptions granted by member states to aerodromes before the entry into force of this regulation should remain valid, while it should be ensured that information about these exemptions is made available to the public. (7) member states may co nsider it preferable, notably with a view to achieving safety, interoperability or efficiency gains, to apply the provisions of this regulation, instead of their national law, to aircraft carrying out military, customs, police, search and rescue, firefight ing, border control and coastguard or similar activities and services undertaken in the public interest . they should be allowed to do so. the commission should be given the necessary implementing powers to decide on such requests. member states making use of this possibility should cooperate with the european union aviation safety agency (hereinafter 'the agency'), in particular by providing all the information necessary for confirming that the aircraft and activities concerned comply with the relevant prov isions of this regulation. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 5 annex dge 2a en (8) the measures taken in accordance with this regulation to regulate civil aviation in the union, including the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, should correspond to and be proportionate to the natu re and risks associated with the different types of operations and activities they address. they should also, in as far as possible, be formulated in a manner which focuses on objectives to be achieved, while allowing different means of achieving those obj ectives. this should contribute to a more cost -efficient achievement of required safety levels and to stimulating technical and operational innovation. use should be made of recognised industry standards and practices, where it has been found that they ens ure compliance with the essential requirements set out in this regulation. (9) application of sound safety management principles is essential for continuous improvement of civil aviation safety in the union, anticipating emerging safety risks, and making b est use of limited technical resources. it is therefore necessary to establish a common framework for planning and implementing safety improvement actions. to that end a european plan for aviation safety and a european aviation safety programme should be d rawn up at union level. each member state should also draw up a state safety programme in accordance with the requirements contained in annex 19 to the chicago convention. that programme should be accompanied by a plan describing the actions to be taken by the member state to mitigate the identified safety risks. (10) in accordance with the provisions laid down in annex 19 to the chicago convention, member states are to establish an acceptable level of safety performance in relation to the aviation activiti es under their responsibility. in order to assist the member states in meeting this requirement in a coordinated manner, the european plan for aviation safety should lay down an acceptable level of safety performance for the union in respect to the differe nt categories of aviation activities. that acceptable level of safety performance should not have a binding character but express the ambition of the union and of the member states with regard to civil aviation safety. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 6 annex dge 2a en (11) the chicago convention provides for minimum standards to ensure the safety of civil aviation and environmental protection relating thereto. the union's essential requirements and further rules for their implementation established in this regulation should ensure that member states fulfi l, in a uniform manner, the obligations laid down in the chicago convention, including those vis -\u00e0-vis third countries. where union rules differ from the minimum standards established by the chicago convention , the obligations of member states to notify th e international civil aviation organization accordingly are not affected . (12) in line with standards and recommended practices set by the chicago convention, essential requirements applicable to aeronautical products, parts, non -installed equipment, aero dromes and the provision of atm/ans should be established. furthermore, essential requirements applicable to persons and organisations involved in the operation of aircraft, the operation of aerodromes and in the provision of atm/ans, and essential require ments applicable to persons and products involved in the training and medical examination of aircrew and air traffic controllers should also be established. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 7 annex dge 2a en (13) the essential requirements concerning environmental compatibility of the design of aeronautic al products should address both aircraft noise as well as emissions, where necessary, to pro tect the environment and human health fro m harmful effects of aviation products . they should correspond to the requirements in this regard which have been established at international level, as laid down in the chicago convention. in order to ensure full consistency, it is appropriate to refer in this regulation to the relevant provisions of that convention as they stand at present. however, products, parts and non -installed equipment which at present are not covered by the relevant provisions of the chicago convention should be made subject to the essential requierements for envirnmental compatibility laid down in annex iii to this regulation. the same goes for products, parts and non -installed equipment for propeller -driven aeroplanes with a maximum take -off mass below 8 618 kg, subsonic jet aeroplanes with a maximum take -off mass below 5 700 kg and rotorcraft with a maximum take -off mass below 3 175 kg or t hat are intended for operation at supersonic speed. as regards those products, parts and non -installed equipme nt, provision should also be made for the possibility of further elaborating the essential requirements through the setting of detailed environmen tal protection requirements, taking due account of the relevant provisions of the chicago convention , taking due account of the relevant provisions of the chicago convention and the need to ensure international compatibility of environmental certification requirements, especially as regards aeronautical products marketed on a worldwide basis. (14) the union should also lay down essential requirements for the safe provision of ground handling services and apron management services. (15) in view of the increasing reliance of civil aviation on modern information and communication technologies essential requirements should be laid down to ensure the security of information used by the civil aviation sector. (15a) the obligations of an aerodrome operat or may be fulfilled directly by the aerodrome operator or, in some cases, by a third party. in such cases the aerodrome operator should have arrangements in place with that third party to ensure compliance with this regulation and the measures adopted on t he basis thereof. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 8 annex dge 2a en (15b) this regulation should lay down essential requirements concerning reporting and analysis of safety occurrences. the detailed rules adopted in order to ensure uniform implementation of and compliance with these essential requirement s should be consistent with the regulation (eu) no 376/2014 of the european parliament and of the council. (16) aeronautical products, parts and non -installed equipment, aerodromes and their equipment, operators of aircraft and aerodromes, atm/ans systems and providers, as well as pilots, air traffic controllers and persons, products and organisations involved in their training and medical examination, should be certified or licensed once they have been found to comply with relevant essential requirements o r, where relevant, the other requirements established in or pursuant to this regulation. the commission should be empowered to adopt the necessary detailed rules for the issuance of those certificates and where relevant, the declarations to be made to this effect, taking into account the objectives of the regulation and the nature and risk of the particular activity concerned. (17) the possibility should be given to the organisations involved in the design and manufacture of aeronautical products and parts to declare the compliance of the design of products and parts with the relevant industry standards, where this is considered to ensure an acceptable level of safety. this possibility should be limited to products used in sport and recreational aviation, and under appropriate limitations and conditions to ensure safety. (18) since unmanned aircraft also operate within the airspace alongside with t manned aircraft, this regulation should cover such aircraft, regardless of their operating mass. technologies for unmanned aircraft now allow for a wide range of operations possible. the provisions of this regulation should open the wide use of unmanned aircraft operations by introducing rules that are proportionate to the risk of the particular operation or type of operations and that strive, as far as possible, to ensure the continuation of existing activities. (18a) in order to implement a risk -based approach and the principle of proportionality, a degree of flexibility should be provided for the member states a s regards unmanned aircraft operations, taking into account various local characteristics of member states such as population density, while ensuring an adequate level of safety. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 9 annex dge 2a en (19) the rules regarding unmanned aircraft should as much as possible contribute to achieving compliance with relevant rights guaranteed under union law, in particular the right to respect for private and family life, as set out in article 7 of the charter of f undamental rights of the european union, and with the right to protection of personal data, as set out in article 8 of that charter and in article 16 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union ('tfeu') and as regulated in directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 3. (20) for some types of unmanned aircraft, the application of the provision s of this regulation related to certification, oversight and enforcement, as well as of the provisions regarding the agency is not necessary for the purpose of reaching adequate levels of safety. market surveillance mechanisms provided by union product har monisation legislation should be made applicable to those cases. (20a) the conditions for situations in which the design, production, maintenance and operation of unmanned aircraft, as well as the personnel and organisations involved in these activities, should be subject to certification, should take into account the nature and risk of the type of operation concerned . these conditions should in particular take into account the type, scale, and complexity of the operation, including, where relevant, the siz e and type of the traffic handled by the responsible organisation or person; whether the operation is open to members of the public; the extent to which other air traffic or persons and property on the ground could be endangered by the operation; the purpo se of the flight and type of airspace used; the complexity and performance of the unmanned aircraft involved. 3 directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (oj l 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31). 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 10 annex dge 2a en (20b ) provision should be made for the possibility to prohibit, limit or make subject to certain conditions the activities referred to in chapter iii of this regulation where necessary in the interest of civil aviation safety. it is also appropriate to clarify that the provisions of that chapter, in particular those relating to the operation of unmanned aircraft, do not affect the possibility of me mber states to prohibit, limit or make subject to certain conditions those activitie s, for reasons falling outsi de the scope of this regulation, while maintaining an adequate safety level. those reasons can include the safeguarding of security, privacy, personal data or the environment . (21) in order to achieve the objectives of this regulation, the commission, the agency and the competent authorities of the member states should, by sharing resources and working jointly, act as a single european aviation sa fety system. (21a) it is necessary to support member states in performing their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks by establishing an efficient framework for pooling and sharing of aviation inspectors and other specialists with relevant experti se. (22) the agency and the national competent authorities should work in partnership in order t o improve detection of unsafe conditions and take remedial measures as appropriate. member states should in particular be able to reallocate to each other or to the agency the responsibilities under this regulation related to certification, oversight and enforcement, especially where that is necessary for enhanced safety or more efficient use of resources. such reallocation should be voluntary, only take place wh ere there is sufficient assurance that those tasks can be performed effectively and should, considering the close relationship between certification, oversight and enforcement, necessarily concern all those responsibilities in respect of the legal or natur al person, aircraft, equipment, aerodrome, system or constituent concerned by the reallocation. the reallocation of responsibility should be subject to mutual consent, the possibility to revoke the reallocation and the conclusion of arrangements setting out the necessary details to ensure a smooth transition and the continued effective performance of the tasks concerned. when concluding those detailed arrangements, due account should be taken of the views and legitimate interests of the legal or natural per sons concerned and, where applicable, the views of the agency. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 11 annex dge 2a en (22a) upon such reallocation of responsibility to another member state, the national competent authority of the member state which accepted the reallocation request should become the competent authority and thus have all powers and responsibilities in respect of the legal or natural persons concerned as provided for in this regulation, the implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof and the national law of the member state which accepted the request. the reallocation in respect of enforcement should concern on ly decisions and measures related to tasks in the area of certification and oversight, reallocated to the national competent authority of the member state which accepted the request. those decisions and measures should be subject to review by the national courts of that member state in accordance with its national law. that member state may be held liable for the performance of the tasks in question. all other enforcement responsibilities of the member state which made the request should remain unaffected b y the reallocation. (22b) the possibility to reallocate responsibility for the performance of the tasks related to certificaton, oversight and enforcement provided for in this regulation to the agency or another member state should be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the member states under the chicago convention. consequently, whereas such reallocation implies a transfer of responsibility to the agency or to another member state for the purposes of union law, it leaves the responsibility of the member state which made the request under the chicago convention unaffected. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 12 annex dge 2a en (22c) in certain cases, several member states may wish to be jointly responsible for the performance of the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement in r espect of air operators. that possibility should be expressly provided for, subject to compliance with certain conditions which aim to ensure that the joint responsibility is justified and that the applicable requirements are respected in full, including t hrough the establishment of the necessary detailed arrangements between the member states concerned regarding the modalities for the joint exercise of the responsibility. joint responsibility should not be permitted, however, where it concerns more than fi ve member states, considering the practical and legal complications that can be expected to arise in such cases. furthermore, in order to ensure objective verification, transparency and legal certainty, the member states concerned should only be allowed to enter into joint responsibility after the commission has decided that the applicable conditions have been complied with. (22d) the rules and procedures pertaining to joint responsibility set out in this regulation should apply in the same manner independe ntly from the legal situation of the air operator and the member states concerned at the moment of the notification of the intended decision. the procedure should also be available in respect of air operators which at the date from which this regulation ap plies, already hold a certificate issued by the national competent authorities of several member states and, as the case may be, third countries which apply union aviation safety legislation on the basis of an international agreement concluded with the uni on. the introduction of an explicit provision on the possibility of joint responsibility in this regulation as such should not be understood as affecting existing legal situations. (23) [\u2013] (24) in order to achieve the main objectives of this regulation, a s well as objectives related to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, the certificates issued and declarations made in accordance with this regulation and the implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, should be valid, without fur ther requirements or evaluation, in all member states. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 13 annex dge 2a en (25) when issuing certificates pursuant to this regulation, account may need to be taken of certificates, or other relevant documentation attesting compliance, issued in accordance with the laws of th ird countries. that should be done where the relevant international agreements concluded by the union with third countries or the implementing acts adopted by the commission pursuant to this regulation so provide, and in accordance with those agreements or implementing acts. (26) in light of the rules on the acceptance of certificates and other relevant documentation attesting compliance, issued in accordance with the laws of third countries, for which this regulation provides, any international agreements concluded between a member state and third countries should be terminated or updated where such agreements are not compatible with those rules. (27) a degree of flexibility should be provided for with respect to the application of the rules set out in this regulation or adopted on the bas is thereof, in order to allow member states to take the necessary measures to react immediately to problems relating to civil aviation safety or to grant exemptions in the event of certain urgent unforeseeable circumstances or operational needs, subject to appropriate conditions to ensure, in particular, proportionality, objective control and transparency. for reasons of proportionality, the agency and the commission should only assess the measures or exemptions in question with a view to issuing a recommen dation or taking a decision, respectively, where their duration exceeds the duration of one airline scheduling season, that is, eight months, without prejudice to the powers of the commission under article 258 of the tfeu. where the agency is the competent authority with respect to the issuing of certain certificates in accordance with this regulation, it should also be empowered to grant such exemptions, in the same situations and subject to the same conditions as those that apply with respect to the membe r states. in this connection provision should also be made for possible amendments, where appropriate, of the relevant rules as laid down in implementing acts adopted on the basis of this regulation, in particular so as to allow other means of compliance w hile still ensuring an acceptable level of civil aviation safety in the union. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 14 annex dge 2a en (28) with a view to ensuring the proper application of this regulation and having regard to the need to identify, assess and mitigate the risks for civil aviation safety, the c ommission, the agency and the national competent authorities should exchange any information available to them in the context of the application of this regulation. for this purpose, the agency should be allowed to organise a structured cooperation on gath ering, exchange and analysis of relevant safety -related information. to this end it should be allowed to enter into the necessary administrative arrangements. (28a) it is necessary to establish measures to ensure the appropriate protection of information gathered, exchanged and analysed under this regulation by the commission, the agency and the national competent authorities, as well as to ensure the protection of the sources of such information. these measures should not unduly interfere with the justice systems of the member states. they should therefore be without prejudice to the applicable national material and procedural criminal laws, including the use of information as evidence. in addition, the rights of third parties to institute civil proceedings should not be affected by these measures and should be subject only to national law. (29) in order to facilitate the exchange between the member states, the commission and the agency of information, including data, which is relevant for certification, ove rsight and enforcement activities , an electronic repository of such information should be established and managed by the agency in cooperation with the member states and the commission. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 15 annex dge 2a en (30) directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and the council ap plies to the processing of personal data carried out in application of this regulation. pursuant to that directive, member states may provide for exemptions and restrictions in respect of some of the rights and obligations provided for therein, including a s regards the processing of medical and health data. the processing of personal data, and in particular medical and health data, in the context of the repository pursuant to article 63 of this regulation is necessary to enable effective cooperation between the member states in certification and oversight of medical fitness of pilots. exchange of personal data should be subject to strict conditions, and limited to what is absolutely necessary for achieving the objectives of this regulation. in view of the ab ove, the principles set out in directive 95/46/ec should be supplemented or clarified in this regulation, where necessary. (31) regulation (ec) no 45/2001 of the european parliament and of the council 4 and in particular the provisions thereof concerning co nfidentiality and security of processing, apply to the processing of personal data by the agency when carrying out its responsibilities in application of this regulation and more specifically in the management of the repository pursuant to article 63 of th is regulation. in view of the above, the principles set out in regulation (ec) no 45/2001 should be supplemented or clarified in this regulation, where necessary. (32) the agency has been established by regulation (ec) no 1592/2002 of the european parliame nt and of the council 5 within the union's existing institutional structure and balance of powers, is independent in relation to technical matters and has legal, administrative and financial autonomy. the agency has received further competences in accordanc e with regulation (ec) no 216/2008. certain adjustments should be made in its structure and functioning in order to better accommodate the new tasks conferred on it by this regulation. 4 regulation (ec) no 45/2001 of the european parliament and of the council of 18 december 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (oj l 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1). 5 regulation (ec) no 1592/2002 of the european parliament and of the council of 15 july 2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a european aviation safety agency, (oj l 240, 7.9.2002, p. 1). 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 16 annex dge 2a en (33) under the institutional system of the union, implementation of un ion law is primarily the responsibility of the member states. certification, oversight and enforcement tasks required by this regulation, and by the implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, should therefore in principle be carried out at national le vel by one or more competent authorities of the member states. in certain clearly defined cases, however, the agency should also be empowered to conduct those tasks as specified in this regulation. in those cases the agency should also be allowed to take t he necessary measures related to the operation of aircraft, the qualification of aircrew or the use of third -country aircraft, where this is the best means to ensure uniformity and facilitate the functioning of the internal market. (34) the agency should p rovide the technical expertise to the commission in the preparation of the necessary legislation and assist, where appropriate, the member states and industry in its implementation. it should be able to issue certification and other detailed specifications and guidance material and to make technical findings and issue certificates or register declarations as required. (35) global navigation satellite systems, and in particular the union galileo programme, will play a pivotal role in the implementation of a european air traffic management system. the agency should be empowered to develop the necessary technical specifications and to certify organisations providing atm/ ans within most or all member states and which may also extend beyond the airspace above the territory to which the treaties apply, such as the union egnos service provider , to ens ure a high, uniform level of safety, interoperability and operational efficienc y. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 17 annex dge 2a en (36) regulation (ec) no 2111/2005 of the european parliament and of the council 6 imposes a duty on the agency to communicate all information that could be relevant for the updating of the list of air carriers which, for safety reasons, are subject to a n operating ban in the union. the agency should also assist the commission in the implementation of regulation (ec) no 2111/2005, by conducting the necessary evaluations of third country operators and authorities responsible for their oversight, and making appropriate recommendations to the commission. (37) in order to ensure compliance with this regulation, it should be possible to impose fines or periodic penalty payments, or both, on holders of certificates issued by the agency and on undertakings that made declarations to the agency, where they infringed the rules applicable to them pursuant to this regulation. such fines and periodic penalty payments should be imposed by the commission acting upon a recommendation of the agency. in this regard, the com mission should, in light of the circumstances of each individual case, respond to such infringements in a proportionate and adequate manner, taking account of other possible measures such as the withdrawal of a certificate. (38) with a view to contributing to the uniform application of this regulation, the agency should be empowered to monitor such application by member states, including by conducting inspections. (39) on the basis of its technical expertise, the agency should assist the commission in the definition of research policy and in the implementation of union research programmes. it should be allowed to conduct research which is immediately needed and to participate in ad hoc research projects under the union framework programme for research and in novation or other union and non -union private or public funding programmes. 6 regulation (ec) no 2111/2005 of the european parliament and of the council of 14 december 2005 on the establishment of a community list of air carriers subject to an operating ban within the community and on informing air transport passengers of the identity of the operating air carrier (oj l 344, 27.12.2005, p. 15). 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 18 annex dge 2a en (40) having regard to the existing interdependencies between safety and security in civil aviation, the agency should take part in the cooperation concerning the area of aviation security, including cyber -security. it should contribute its expertise to the implementation, by the commission and by member states, of union rules in that area. (41) the agency should, on request, assist the member states and commission in the field of international relations relating to matters covered by this regulation, in particular as regards the harmonisation of rules and the mutual recognition of certificates. it should be entitled to establish the appropriate relations, through working arrangement s, with the authorities of third countries and international organisations competent in matters covered by this regulation, subject to the commission's prior approval. in order to promote safety at the worldwide level, in light of the high standards applie d within the union, the agency should be allowed to engage, within its field of competence, in ad hoc technical cooperation, research and assistance projects with third countries and international organisations. the agency should also assist the commission in the implementation of union legislation in other technical domains of civil aviation regulation, such as security or the single european sky, where the agency has the relevant expertise. (42) in order to promote best practices and a uniform implementat ion of union aviation safety legislation, the agency may approve providers of aviation training and provide training. (43) the agency should be governed and operated in line with the principles of the joint statement of the european parliament, the council and the european commission on decentralised agencies of 19 july 2012. (44) the member states and the commission should be represented within the management board of the agency in order to effectively control its functions. that management board should be entrusted with the necessary powers notably to appoint the executive director, and to adopt the consolidated annual activity report, the programming document, the annual budget, and the financial rules applicable to the agency. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 19 annex dge 2a en (45) in the interests of t ransparency, interested parties should be given observer status within the management board of the agency. (46) [\u2013] (47) public interest requires the agency to base its safety -related action solely on independent expertise, strictly applying this regulatio n and the implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof. to that end, safety -related decisions of the agency should be made by its executive director, who should enjoy a high degree of flexibility to obtain advice and to organise the internal functioning of the agency. (48) it is necessary to ensure that parties affected by decisions made by the agency enjoy the necessary remedies in a manner which is suited to the special character of the field of aviation. therefore, an appropriate appeal mechanism shoul d be set up so that decisions of the agency can be subject to appeal to a specialised board of appeal, the decisions of which can be subject to action before the court of justice of the european union (the 'court of justice') in accordance with the tfeu. (49) all decisions taken by the commission under this regulation are subject to review by the court of justice in accordance with the tfeu. the court of justice should, in accordance with article 261 of the tfeu, be given unlimited jurisdiction in respect o f decisions by which the commission imposes fines or periodic penalty payments. (50) when the agency develops draft rules of a general nature to be implemented by national authorities, member states should be consulted. furthermore, where rules could have important social implications, stakeholders, including union social partners, should be appropriately consulted when the agency prepares corresponding draft rules. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 20 annex dge 2a en (51) with a view to effectively carrying out its tasks under this regulation, the agency s hould cooperate, as necessary, with other union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in areas where their activities affect technical aspects of civil aviation. in particular, the agency should collaborate with the european chemicals agency in the ex change of information on the safety of chemical substances, their impact on aviation safety and related scientific and technical aspects. when consultation relating to military aspects is required, the agency should, in addition to the member states, consu lt the european defence agency. (52) it is necessary to provide the public with adequate information pertaining to the level of civil aviation safety and environmental protection relating thereto, taking into account regulation (ec) no 1049/2001 of the eu ropean parliament and of the council and relevant national legislation. (53) in order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the agency, it should be granted an autonomous budget principally funded from a contribution from the union and from f ees and charges paid by the users of the european aviation safety system. any financial contribution received by the agency from member states, third countries, or other entities or persons should not compromise its independence and impartiality. the union budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the union contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the european union are concerned, while the auditing of accounts should be carried out by the court of auditors. in order to enable the agency to participate in all relevant future projects, it should be provided with the possibility to receive grants. (53a) [\u2013] 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 21 annex dge 2a en (54) in order to ensure that the agency can respond to demand for the activities it carries out, in particular as regards certification and activities related to a possible reallocation of responsibility from member states, in an efficient and timely manner, while respecting sound financial management, the establishment plan should take into account the resources req uired to meet demands for certification and for other activities of the agency in an efficient and timely manner, including those resulting from reallocation of responsibility in accordance with articles 53 and 54. to this end, a set of indicators should b e established to measure the agency's workload and efficiency in relation to activities financed through fees and charges. having regard to those indicators the agency should adapt its staff planning and management of resources related to fees and charges so as to be able to adequately respond to such demand and to any fluctuations in revenue from fees and charges. (55) [\u2013] [covered by 28a]. (56) the fees and charges levied by the agency should be set in a transparent, fair, non - discriminatory and uniform manner. they should not jeopardize the competitiveness of the union's industry concerned. furthermore, they should be established on a basis whic h takes due account of the ability of the legal or natural persons concerned to pay, in particular regarding small and medium -sized enterprises. (57) in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation, implementing powers shou ld be conferred on the commission. those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council 7. (58) the commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly just ified cases relating to corrective action and safeguard measures, imperative grounds of urgency so require. 7 regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council of 16 february 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by member states of the commission\u2122s exercise of implementing powers (oj l 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13). 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 22 annex dge 2a en (59) in order to take into account technical, scientific, operational or safety needs in the field of unmanned aircraft operations , by amending or supplementing the requirements set out in annex ix to this regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the tfeu should be delegated to the commission for a period of five years . in addition, the commission should be empowered to a mend the references to the provisions of the chicago convention laid down in article 9(2), in order to update them in light of subsequent amendmends to annex 16 to that convention. it is of particular importance that the commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement on better law -making of 13 april 2016. in particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the european parliament and the council receive all documents at the same time as member states' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of commission expert groups dealin g with the preparation of delegated acts. (59a) the annexes to this regulation contain already well established essential requirements which are not expected to be modified regularly. however, in view of the rapid technological evolution and changes expect ed in the field of unmanned aircraft, the commission should be exceptionally empowered, for a limited period of five years, to amend or supplement, by means of delegated acts, annex ix setting out the essential requirements for unmanned aircraft. (60) the involvement of european third countries should be pursued to ensure the improvement of civil aviation safety throughout europe. those countries that have concluded international agreements with the union to adopt and apply the union acquis in the field cov ered by this regulation should be associated with the work of the agency in accordance with conditions set in the framework of those agreements. 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 23 annex dge 2a en (61) this regulation sets common rules in the field of civil aviation and maintains the establishment of the a gency. regulation (ec) no 216/2008 of the european parliament and of the council 8 should therefore be repealed. (61a) this regulation sets common rules in the field of atm/ans systems and atm/ans constituents. regulation (ec) no 552/2004 of the european pa rliament and of the council should therefore be repealed. (61b) regulation (ec) no 216/2008 provides for the deletion of annex iii to council regulation (eec) no 3922/91 9 from the entry into force of the corresponding measures referred to in article 8(5) of regulation (ec) no 216/2008. considering that all of those measures will be applicable by 1 april 2019 and that other provisions of regulation (ecc) no 3922/91 have bec ome obsolete, council regulation (eec) no 3922/91 should be repealed from that date. however, regulation (eec) no 3922/91 also establishes the committee, within the meaning of regulation (eu) no 182/2011, known as the 'eu air safety committee', and that committee also assists the commission in the context of regulation (ec) no 2111/2005. regulation (ec) no 2111/2005 should therefore be amended so as to ensure that, for the purposes of that regulation, that committee continues to assist the commission also a fter the repeal of regulation (eec) no 3922/91. 8 regulation (ec) no 216/2008 of the european parliament and of the council of 20 february 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a european aviation safety agency ( oj l 240, 7.9.2002, p. 1). 9 council regulation (eec) no 3922/91 of 16 december 1991 on the harmoniz ation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation (oj l 373, 31.12.1991, p. 4). 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 24 annex dge 2a en (62) the changes brought about by this regulation have an impact on the implementation of other union legislation. regulation (ec) no 1008/2008 of the european parliament and of the council 10, regulation (eu) no 996/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 11, regulation (eu) no 376/2014 of the european parliament and of the council 12, and regulation (ec) no 2111/2005 of the european parliament and of the council should therefore be amended accordingly. (63) regulation (ec) no 1008/2008 should be amended to take due account of the possibility established by this regulation that the agency may become the competent authority for the issuance and oversight of air operator certificates. moreover, given the g rowing importance of air carriers with operational bases in several member states which results in the competent authority for the operating licences and the competent authority for air operator certificates no longer being necessarily identical, there is a need to reinforce the efficient supervision of those air carriers. regulation (ec) no 1008/2008 should therefore be amended to ensure close cooperation between the authorities responsible for the oversight in respect of the air operator certificate and t he operating licence respectively. 10 regulation (ec) no 1008/2008 o f the european parliament and of the council of 24 september 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the community (oj l 293, 31.10.2008, p. 3). 11 regulation (eu) no 996/2010 of the european parliament and of the council of 20 october 2010 on the investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation and repealing directive 94/56/ec (oj l 295, 12.11.2010, p. 35). 12 regulation (eu) no 376/2014 of the european parliament and of the council of 3 april 2014 on the reporting, analysis and follow -up of occurrences in civil aviation, amending regulation (eu) no 996/2010 of the european parliament and of the council and repealing directive 2003/42/ec of the european parliament and of the council and commission regulations (ec) no 1321/2007 and (ec) no 1330/2007 (oj l 122, 24.4.2014, p. 18). 14469/16 add 1 ml/nc 25 annex dge 2a en (64) since the objectives of this regulation, namely establishing and maintaining a high uniform level of civil aviation safety, while ensuring a high uniform level of environmental protection, cannot be sufficiently ach ieved by the member states because of the largely transnational nature of aviation and its complexity, but can rather, by reason of the union -wide scope of this regulation, be better achieved at union level, the union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the teu. in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that article, this regulation does not go beyond
