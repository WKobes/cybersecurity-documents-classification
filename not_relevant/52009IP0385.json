person; whereas it should be recalled in this connection that the opening words of the universal declaration of human rights read: \u2018recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\u2019, b. whereas justice, freedom, democracy and the rule of law arise out of an authentic recognition of the dignity of the human person, and whereas such recognition is the foundation of all human rights, c. whereas the tenth european union annual report on human rights (2008) produced by the council and the commission provides a general overview of the activities of the eu institutions regarding human rights inside and outside the european union, d. whereas this resolution sets out to examine, evaluate and, in specific cases, offer constructive criticism of the human rights activities of the commission, the council and parliament, e. whereas the european union's internal human rights record has a direct impact on its credibility and ability to implement an effective external human rights policy, f. whereas efforts must be made to focus greater attention on respect for basic human rights, in particular political rights, in the negotiation and implementation of bilateral or regional trade agreements, even those concluded with important trading partners, g. whereas it is necessary to respect the human rights clauses in the agreements signed by the eu and its third-country partners, h. whereas policies promoting human rights remain under threat in various regions of the world, as the violation of human rights inevitably goes hand in hand with an effort by their violators to reduce the impact of any policy promoting them, particularly in countries where human rights violations are crucial in maintaining a non-democratic government in power, 1. considers that the eu needs to move towards a coherent and consistent policy of upholding and promoting human rights around the world, and stresses the need to conduct such a policy more effectively; 2. reiterates its conviction that, in order to effect an improvement in the promotion of human rights, the eu's common foreign and security policy (cfsp) needs to be strengthened, and that it is necessary to ensure that the promotion of human rights as a main objective of the cfsp, as outlined in article 11 of the treaty on european union, is strictly implemented in the eu's dialogues and institutional relations with all the countries of the world; 3. calls on the council and the commission to make greater efforts to improve the ability of the european union to respond rapidly to breaches of human rights by third countries; stresses the key role played by the eu in the sphere of human rights in today's world and the corresponding increased expectations; calls for a common eu human rights line both in its external policy and within its own borders; 4. calls for continued maximum vigilance as regards respect for the human rights clauses in the agreements signed by the eu and its third-country partners, and for such clauses to be included systematically in future agreements; points out that the human rights clause, by virtue of being an essential element, should apply to all the provisions of the agreement; reiterates its call for this clause to be systematically accompanied by a genuine enforcement mechanism; the european union annual report on human rights 2008 5. underlines the relevance of the european union annual report on human rights in analysing and evaluating the european union's human rights policy, and recognises the positive role played by the eu institutions' activities in this field; 6. reiterates its request that more and better information should be provided for the assessment of policies and that elements and guidelines should be proposed to improve the general approach, minimise any contradictions and adjust the policy priorities on a country-by-country basis, with a view to the adoption of a country strategy on human rights or, at least, a human rights chapter in the country strategy papers; reiterates its call for a regular periodic assessment of the use and the results of european union policies, instruments and initiatives on human rights in third countries; calls on the council and the commission to develop specific quantifiable indices and benchmarks in order to measure the effectiveness of those policies; 7. welcomes the public presentation of the 2008 report by the council and the commission at the meeting of parliament's subcommittee on human rights held on 4 november 2008, coinciding with the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights of 10 december 1948, and its presentation in plenary on the same day as the award of its annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought to hu jia from china; 8. calls once again on the council and the commission to identify the \u2018countries of particular concern\u2019 where it is particularly difficult to promote human rights, as well as countries in which human rights are violated, and, to that end, to develop criteria by which to measure countries by reference to their human rights score, thereby enabling specific policy priorities to be established; 9. calls on the council and commission to make greater efforts to disseminate their annual report on human rights and ensure it reaches as large a public as possible; also calls for public information campaigns aimed at raising the eu's profile in this field; 10. calls on the council and commission to carry out regular social impact and awareness studies regarding the union's action in the field of human rights; 11. considers that the report shows that the eu, despite the inquiries undertaken in some member states, has not carried out an evaluation of member states' practices in relation to the anti-terrorism policies followed by the us administration under the bush presidency; 12. in accordance with the resolution unanimously adopted by the peruvian congress in april 2008, calls on the council to envisage inclusion of the movimiento revolucionario t\u00fapac amaru (mrta) on the european list of terrorist organisations; 13. stresses that, in the eyes of large segments of public opinion worldwide, immigration policy represents a challenge for the credibility of the eu's external action in the field of human rights, council and commission activities in the area of human rights in international forums 14. considers that a quantitative and qualitative improvement of the council's human rights secretariat would enable the european union to further raise its profile in promoting and ensuring respect for human rights in its external policy; expects that a future appointment of a high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, who would also be a vice-president of the commission, would considerably enhance the coherence and effectiveness of the eu if the lisbon treaty were to enter into force; 15. considers it essential that, given the importance of human rights issues in conflict and post-conflict situations, all european union special representatives should in future have a mandate which specifically mentions promoting and ensuring respect for human rights; 16. reiterates its request to the commission to encourage european union member states, and third countries with which there are ongoing negotiations for future accession or for strengthening relations, to sign up to, and ratify, all core united nations and council of europe human rights conventions and the optional protocols thereto and to cooperate with international human rights procedures and mechanisms; calls specifically for a framework agreement to be concluded between the european union and the unhcr with a view to promoting the ratification and implementation of united nations conventions by all member states; 17. calls on the council and the commission to continue their vigorous efforts to promote universal ratification of the rome statute and national implementing legislation, in conformity with council common position 2003/444/cfsp of 16 june 2003 on the international criminal court ( 21 ) and the 2004 action plan to follow-up on the common position; requests that such efforts be extended to include ratification and implementation of the agreement on the privileges and immunities of the icc, which is an important operational tool for the icc; welcomes the fact that the ratifications of the rome statute by madagascar, the cook islands and suriname in 2008 brought the total number of states parties to 108 in july 2008; demands that the czech republic, as the only remaining eu member state not to have ratified the rome statute, finally do so without further delay ( 22 ) ; urges romania to rescind its bilateral immunity agreement with the united states; 18. asks all eu presidencies to raise the importance of cooperation with the icc in all eu summits and dialogues with third countries, including in the eu-russia summit and the eu-china dialogues, and urges all eu member states to step up cooperation with the court and to conclude bilateral agreements on the enforcement of sentences, as well as on the protection of witnesses and victims; further acknowledges the cooperation and assistance agreement between the eu and the icc and, on that basis, calls on the european union and its member states to provide the court with all necessary assistance, including field support, in its ongoing cases; within that framework, welcomes the assistance of belgium and portugal in the arrest and surrender to the icc of jean-pierre bemba in may 2008; 19. calls for prompt ratification by the european community and its member states of the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities; insists that the optional protocol to the convention should be regarded as an integral part thereof, and calls for simultaneous accession to the convention and the protocol ( 23 ) ; 20. emphasises the need to strengthen further the active involvement of the european union and its member states with respect to human rights and democracy issues as regards their participation in a variety of international forums in 2009, including in the work of the unhrc, the united nations general assembly, the ministerial council of the organization for security and co-operation in europe (osce) and the council of europe; 21. welcomes the human rights defenders conference financed by the eidhr, which took place in the european parliament in brussels on 7-8 october 2008, as a major inter-institutional initiative by the european parliament, the commission and the united nations, marking the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights; 22. welcomes the cooperation between the european union and the council of europe taking place within the framework of a memorandum of understanding signed in may 2007; welcomes the fact that quadripartite meetings were held on 23 october 2007 and 10 march 2008 between the eu presidency, the commission, the secretary general of the council of europe and the chair of the committee of ministers of the council of europe; reaffirms the importance of further promoting cooperation in the field of human rights, the rule of law and pluralist democracy, which are the shared values of both those organisations and of all the eu member states; 23. welcomes the agreement signed on 18 june 2008 between the commission and the council of europe concerning cooperation in the eu agency for fundamental rights; points out that the agreement includes provisions on the organisation of regular meetings, exchange of information and coordination of activities; 24. welcomes the fact that the convention on cluster munitions was adopted by the dublin diplomatic conference, which took place from 19 to 30 may 2008; is concerned that not all european union member states signed the treaty at the signing conference in oslo on 3 december 2008, and asks them to do so as soon as possible ( 24 ) ; notes that the convention imposes an immediate and unconditional ban on all cluster munitions which cause unacceptable harm to civilians; 25. welcomes the cooperation of serbia in the arrest and transfer of radovan karad\u017ei\u0107 to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty); notes with concern that ratko mladi\u0107 and goran had\u017ei\u0107 remain at large and have not been brought before the icty; in this regard, calls on the serbian authorities to ensure full cooperation with the icty, which should lead to the arrest and transfer of all remaining indictees, in order to open the way to the ratification of a stabilisation and association agreement; 26. urges all member states to collaborate fully in international criminal justice mechanisms, and especially in bringing fugitives to justice; notes with great concern the persistent failure of sudan to arrest and transfer to the icc ahmad muhammad harun (\u2018ahmad harun\u2019) and ali muhammad ali abd-al-rahman (\u2018ali kushayb\u2019), in disregard of its obligations under un security council resolution 1593 (2005); strongly condemns the retaliation by sudan following the issuing of an icc warrant for the arrest of president al-bashir, and expresses its deepest concern at the recent crackdown on human rights defenders, which led in june 2008 to the arrest of mohammed el-sari, who has been sentenced to imprisonment for 17 years for having collaborated with the icc; welcomes the release of hassan al-turabi, leader of the main opposition group, the popular congress party, after two months of custody, for his statement calling on president al-bashir to assume political responsibility for the crimes committed in darfur; finally, recalls its resolution of 22 may 2008 on sudan and the international criminal court ( 25 ) and calls once again on the eu presidencies and the member states to live up to and act on their own words as expressed in the eu declaration of march 2008 and the council conclusions on sudan of june 2008, stating that the eu \u2018stands ready to consider measures against individuals responsible for not cooperating with the icc, should the obligation under the unsc resolution 1593 on cooperation with the icc continue to be disregarded\u2019; 27. welcomes the opening on 26 january 2009 of the first ever trial at the icc, against thomas lubanga of the democratic republic of congo (drc), and notes that it represents the first trial in the history of international criminal law to see the active participation of victims in the proceedings; in that context, urges the icc to intensify its outreach efforts with a view to engaging communities in countries in crisis situations in a process of constructive interaction with the icc, designed to promote understanding and support for its mandate, to manage expectations and to enable those communities to follow and understand the international criminal justice process; welcomes the cooperation of the drc in the transfer of thomas lubanga, germain katanga and mathieu ngudjolo to the icc; however, deplores the fact that the icc warrant for the arrest of bosco ntaganda has not yet been executed, and calls on the upcoming meetings of the general affairs and external relations council to demand the immediate arrest and surrender of bosco ntaganda to the icc; notes with concern that the already volatile situation in the drc has recently been further destabilised by new attacks by the lord's resistance army (lra), which brutally massacred at least 620 civilians and abducted more than 160 children between 24 december 2008 and 13 january 2009 in northern drc; therefore emphasises the need to arrest lra commanders as a matter of urgency, as demanded in parliament's resolution of 21 october 2008 on the indictment and bringing to trial of joseph kony at the international criminal court ( 26 ) ; notes with concern that the icc warrants for the arrest of four members of the lord's resistance army in uganda have still not been executed; 28. notes with satisfaction the first promising statements on the icc by the new us administration, acknowledging that the icc \u2018looks to become an important and credible instrument for trying to hold accountable the senior leadership responsible for atrocities committed in the congo, uganda, and darfur\u2019 ( 27 ) , and calls on the usa to reinstate its signature and further engage with the icc, especially by cooperating in situations which are the subject of an icc investigation or preliminary analysis; 29. notes once again with satisfaction the adoption by the united nations general assembly of the declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, which creates a framework in which states can protect and promote the rights of indigenous people without exclusion or discrimination; urges the commission, therefore, to follow up on the implementation of the declaration, in particular through the eidhr, while in particular enjoining all the member states to ratify as a matter of urgency international labour organization (ilo) convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples, which backs up the principles set out in the declaration in question with a legally binding instrument; however, welcomes the commission's activities targeting indigenous peoples and welcomes the project entitled \u2018promotion of indigenous and tribal peoples' rights through legal advice, capacity-building and dialogue\u2019, initiated as a joint management project between the commission and the ilo; notes that, almost twenty years after its entry into force, only three member states have ratified the ilo convention, namely denmark, the netherlands and spain; consequently, encourages initiatives to increase awareness of this important legislative instrument and to enhance its effectiveness worldwide by ensuring that it is ratified by all the member states; 30. reiterates its call for the development of a european framework strategy on roma, given the special social situation of roma communities in the european union, in the candidate countries and in the countries involved in the stabilisation and association process; notes with satisfaction the commission's first \u2018eu-roma summit\u2019, which took place in september 2008 under the joint patronage of the president of the commission and the french presidency, aiming to promote a firm commitment to tackling concrete problems and to creating mechanisms through which to ensure a better understanding of the situation of roma across europe; 31. welcomes the consensus reached in the durban review conference on an outcome document on 21 april 2009 as a follow-up to the world conference against racism, which inter alia fully protects the right to freedom of expression as defined under international law, affirms and strengthens the call for the protection of migrants' rights, and acknowledges multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination; condemns the speech of president mahmoud ahmadinejad, which contradicted the spirit and purpose of the conference, namely to defeat the scourge of racism; welcomes the substantive sessions of the unhrc acting as the preparatory committee for the durban review conference, which took place from 21 april to 2 may 2008 and from 6 to 17 october 2008; 32. is disappointed at the lack of leadership on the part of the council and the inability of member states to agree on a common strategy at the durban review conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance held in geneva from 20 to 24 april 2009 (durban ii); deeply deplores the lack of unity and cooperation, in particular against the backdrop of the expected intensification of eu foreign policies under the new eu treaty; calls on the commission and, notably, the council to explain to parliament whether an eu strategy was planned and what efforts were made to find a common line, and to report on what happened and on the implications of the outcome of durban ii; 33. welcomes the second european forum on the rights of the child organised by the commission in march 2008, which focused on the matter of child alert mechanisms for missing children and on the issues of child poverty and social exclusion, with special attention to roma children; 34. welcomes the european year of intercultural dialogue 2008, which was initiated by the commission and established by decisions of the european parliament and the council; reiterates that intercultural dialogue has an increasingly important role to play in fostering european identity and citizenship; urges the member states and the commission to bring forward strategies to foster intercultural dialogue, to promote, within their spheres of competence, the objectives of the alliance of civilisations, and to maintain their political support for that alliance; the united nations human rights council 35. welcomes the work of the unhrc and stresses its crucial role within the overall un architecture and its potential to develop a valuable framework for the european union's multilateral human rights efforts; notes that this new body has to keep working in order to gain more credibility; 36. stresses that the role of civil society organisations is indispensable for the efficiency of the unhrc; 37. welcomes the start of the universal periodic review and the first round of the review, which took place in april and may 2008 and ended with adoption of the outcome reports by the unhrc's plenary in june 2008; notes that the implementation of the first two cycles of the new mechanism confirmed the universal periodic review's potential, and trusts that the implementation of the universal periodic review mechanism will achieve further concrete results and improvements; calls on the council and the commission closely to follow and monitor the undertakings of the universal periodic review, and calls on the council to consult parliament on this matter; 38. notes that, as the annual report points out, eu member states are in a minority in the unhrc; calls on the eu institutions and the member states to take concerted action to remedy this, developing appropriate alliances with those countries and non-state actors that are continuing to defend the universal and indivisible nature of human rights; 39. in this regard, calls on the council and the commission to strengthen their engagement with democratic governments from other regional groups within the unhrc, with a view to improving the chance of success of initiatives aimed at respect for the principles contained in the universal declaration of human rights; asks the commission to provide an annual report on voting patterns at the un in matters concerning human rights, analysing how these have been affected by the policies of the eu and of its member states and those of other blocs; 40. calls for enhanced cooperation between the council of europe and the european union in the field of promoting minority rights and protecting regional and minority languages, using the legal tools of non-discrimination to advocate diversity and tolerance; 41. reaffirms the vital importance of the special procedures and country mandates within the unhrc; considers that the process for the renewal of mandates must be transparent; welcomes the new manual of the un special procedures and insists that efforts should continue to appoint independent and experienced candidates who are properly representative, both geographically and in terms of gender; notes the recent developments in the thematic and country mandates; welcomes the newly established thematic mandates, dealing with contemporary forms of slavery and access to safe drinking water and sanitation; welcomes the fact that the mandate of the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in sudan has been extended until june 2009; 42. welcomes the fact that the eu initiated the holding of a special unhrc session on burma in october 2007, which culminated in the adoption of a resolution in june 2008 condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and the recruitment of child soldiers in burma and urging the burmese government unconditionally to release all political prisoners immediately; performance as regards the european union human rights guidelines 43. considers that, despite the delay in final ratification of the lisbon treaty, the preparations for the creation of the new european external action service should be used proactively to harmonise the approaches of the missions of member states and the commission abroad in the area of human rights, by sharing structures and staff so as to create genuine \u2018european union embassies\u2019; 44. takes note of the slovenian and french presidencies' drive to finalise european union human rights guidelines on the rights of the child; is looking forward to receiving within the next year drafts of the specific implementing measures that will concentrate on implementing the holistic and comprehensive approach which the core guidelines develop; 45. considers that measures should be taken to ensure that human rights issues are followed in a more systematic way by the eu missions, for instance by appointing human rights focal points and including guidelines on human rights and their implementation in eu mission staff training programmes; situation of women, violence against women and feminicide 46. welcomes the new priority status given by the french presidency in the second half of 2008 to women's issues in the context of the eu's action in the field of human rights; stresses, in particular, the need to tackle the tragic phenomena of violence against women (including the practice of female circumcision) and feminicide (including the practice of gender-selective abortion); 47. given the failure of the international community to bring about change for the better in zimbabwe \u2013 a human rights catastrophe \u2013 calls on the council and member states to examine the reasons behind this, to determine more effective policies, and to inform parliament what action they intend to take, given the extent of the relationship between the eu and its member states and many african countries, in particular in southern africa; 48. welcomes the adoption of new guidelines on 8 december 2008, thereby establishing a comprehensive strategy for strengthening eu action to enhance women's security , especially in conflict-affected countries, as well as in other countries; deplores, however, the fact that parliament was not more closely involved in the drafting of those new guidelines and calls in this regard for a mechanism to be established in future for consultation with parliament both when the new guidelines are being drawn up and when they are being assessed and revised; 49. draws attention, none the less, to the existing gaps in the development of the union's policies and actions relating to the human rights of women; finds these gaps reflected in the council's report, inasmuch as, when assessing various specific areas, it fails to go into detail; the death penalty 50. recalls the resolution on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty (resolution 62/149) adopted by the united nations general assembly on 18 december 2007, calling for a global moratorium on the use of the death penalty; stresses that the resolution ends by calling on all united nations member states to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty; 51. welcomes the joint declaration against the death penalty, signed on 10 october 2008 by the presidents of the european parliament, of the council and of the commission, on behalf of the eu, and by the president of the parliamentary assembly, the chairman of the committee of ministers and the secretary general of the council of europe, on the \u2018european day against the death penalty\u2019, which is celebrated on 10 october each year; reiterates that the prohibition of the death penalty is one of the key provisions of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union, article 2 of which explicitly states: \u2018no one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed\u2019; 52. welcomes the revised and updated version of the eu guidelines on the death penalty; reiterates that the eu is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, and emphasises once again that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights; 53. calls on the presidency to encourage italy, latvia, poland and spain, which have signed but not yet ratified protocol no 13 to the echr concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances, to do so; recognises in that regard that the guidelines on the death penalty could be implemented more coherently if member states were to sign up to and ratify such protocols and conventions; 54. welcomes the fact that the death penalty is in retreat, having been abolished for all crimes in 2008 by rwanda and uzbekistan; welcomes the draft penal code in iran, which prohibits stoning sentences, and urges the iranian parliament to conclude the penal code so as to provide for the absolute prohibition of stoning; condemns the fact that the iranian regime still sentences to death and executes defendants under the age of 18 (particularly those whose only \u2018crime\u2019 under sharia law is having committed acts of homosexuality); stresses that iran is the only country to have executed juvenile offenders in 2008; is deeply concerned that at least 130 other juvenile offenders are on death row in iran; once again condemns the iranian regime's increasing use of the death penalty, which places iran in second position, just after china, in the league table of countries having the highest number of executions; notes that there has not been any death sentence passed in guatemala; however, expresses its disquiet at the possibility that the death penalty might once again start to be enforced; urges the guatemalan government, on the contrary, to genuinely commit itself to the universal moratorium on the death penalty; however, welcomes the decisions taken by president colom in march 2008 which may lead to the abolition of the death penalty

being subjected to torture or ill-treatment; 62. notes the importance of council regulation (ec) no 1236/2005 of 27 june 2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital

has been interrupted since 2004 due to the absence of any positive progress in improving the human rights situation and a lack of cooperation from iran; calls on the iranian authorities to resume this

foster democratic, institutional and constitutional reforms, ensure the sustainability of those reforms and consolidate the involvement of all iranian human rights defenders and civil society

rights activists; remains concerned about the repression of ethnic and religious minorities in iran; condemns the increasing use of the death penalty in iran, including in respect of juveniles; 91.

expression and assembly, the functioning of civil society, minority rights, combating racism and xenophobia and the rights of children and women, as well as the international human rights obligations of both the eu and russia; regrets that, despite this, the european union has not succeeded in bringing about any change of policy in russia, particularly with regard to impunity and the independence of the judiciary, the treatment of human rights defenders and political prisoners including mikhail khodorkovsky, the independence of the media and freedom of expression, the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, respect for the rule of law and human rights protection in the armed forces, discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as other issues; refers to its resolution of 19

russian authorities to further restrict the right to free expression of independent journalists and political opponents; expresses further concern, in line with the amnesty international report of 2008, as to the ongoing failure of the office of the prosecutor to respect the right of mikhail khodorkovsky and his associate platon lebedev to a fair trial in accordance with international

such subcommittees and to be informed of their outcome; welcomes the consultation with civil society, both before and after, by the commission delegation in the country concerned and by the commission's relevant departments in brussels; questions, however, the effectiveness and coherence of the methodology used, and, in particular, of the criteria for evaluating the discussions held in these subcommittees; believes that these subcommittees should allow the human rights issues included in the action plan to be specifically followed up but stresses that discussions on human rights should certainly not be confined to these subcommittees, and emphasises the importance of coordination with other subcommittees dealing with human rights-related issues, such as migration; highlights the need to include these issues in the political dialogue up to the highest level so as to increase the coherence of the eu's policy in this field; is convinced that the european neighbourhood policy as designed and structured (action plan, follow-up report and subcommittees) could give real leverage for the promotion of human rights were the european union to demonstrate a genuine political will

for strengthening relations between the union and a third country; in the context of concluding a framework agreement with libya, calls on the council and the commission to give due attention to

that the commission has selected 11 beneficiaries to implement these projects and expects that real activities will start at the beginning of 2009; 113. once again calls on the commission to adjust the level of staffing allocated for the implementation of the eidhr, both at headquarters and in the delegations, so as to take account of the peculiarities and problems of this new instrument; 114. calls on the commission to ensure coherence between the union's political priorities and the projects and programmes which it supports, particularly in connection with its bilateral programming with third countries; electoral assistance and election observation 115. notes with satisfaction that the eu makes increasing use of electoral assistance and election observation to promote democracy in third countries, thereby enhancing respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and that the quality and independence of these missions are widely recognised; 116. stresses that the comprehensive eu methodology, which covers the whole electoral cycle and includes both electoral assistance and election observation, has been very successful for the eu, transforming it into a leading international election observation organisation; 117. welcomes the first handbook for eu election observation, issued in april 2008; notes with satisfaction the specific section on gender issues; notes that the new handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the eu election observation mission's methodology and a description of how the missions are planned, deployed and implemented as well as of how the international standards are used in assessment and reporting; 118. calls for increased vigilance with regard to the criteria for selection of the countries in which electoral assistance/election observation is to take place, and for compliance with the methodology and rules set up at international level, particularly concerning the independent nature of the mission; 119. reiterates its calls for the electoral process, including both the pre- and post-electoral stages, to be incorporated into the different levels of political dialogue with the third countries concerned, with a view to ensuring the coherence of eu policies and reaffirming the crucial role of human rights and democracy; mainstreaming of human rights 120. calls on the commission to continue to monitor closely the granting of \u2018generalised system of preferences plus\u2019 (gsp+) benefits to countries which have shown serious flaws in the implementation of the eight ilo conventions relating to core labour standards, on account of breaches of civil and political rights or the use of prison labour; asks the commission to develop criteria determining when the gsp should be withdrawn on human rights grounds; economic, social and cultural (esc) rights 121. underlines that economic, social and cultural rights are just as important as civil and political rights; underlines the eu's commitment to supporting the achievements of the millennium development goals, as set out in the conclusions of the european councils held in december 2007 and june 2008; 122. calls on the eu to mainstream protection of esc rights into its external relations with third countries, regularly placing them on the agenda of human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries and pressing for implementation of the optional protocol to the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, especially with a view to the effective functioning of its individual complaint procedure; 123. calls on the council and the commission to ensure the coherence of esc rights in the eu's development, external trade and human rights policies, and, to that end, to set up an inter-service working group on esc rights; 124. stresses that human rights also include rights to food, to adequate housing, to education, to water, to land, to decent work, to social security and to form a trade union, and that it is especially important to ensure that those rights are enjoyed by extremely vulnerable groups such as people in least-developed, post-conflict or emerging countries, indigenous peoples, climate-change refugees, migrants, etc.; 125. calls on the commission to make a special effort with a view to ensuring the right to food in the present food and general economic crisis; 126. underlines the need to promote corporate social responsibility and to oblige trans-national companies with headquarters in eu member states to respect, in their third-country operations, the relevant ilo regulations; 127. is pleased to note that the gsp+ regime, by linking human rights and international trade, encourages sustainable development as well as good governance, and calls for the effective monitoring of compliance with the essential element clause; 128. once again calls on the council and the commission to take eu initiatives at international level with a view to fighting persecution and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, e.g. by promoting a resolution on this issue at united nations level and granting support to ngos and actors who promote equality and non-discrimination; effectiveness of the european parliament's interventions in human rights cases 129. expects that resolutions and other key documents relating to human rights issues will be translated into the language spoken in the targeted areas; 130. welcomes the ground-breaking statement, supported by 66 nations including all eu member states, presented in the un general assembly on 18 december 2008, confirming that international human rights protections include sexual orientation and gender identity and reaffirming the principle of non-discrimination, which requires that human rights apply equally to every human being regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity; 131. calls on the council to respond in a substantive manner to the wishes and concerns expressed in formal communications from parliament, particularly with respect to urgency resolutions; 132. reminds parliament's delegations visiting third countries that they should systematically include in the agenda an interparliamentary debate on the human rights situation, as well as meetings with human rights defenders, in order to learn first-hand about the human rights situation in the country concerned and to provide them, where appropriate, with international visibility and protection; 133. is convinced that only a strengthened human rights body in parliament would be able to promote a coherent, effective, systematic and cross-cutting human rights policy within parliament and vis-\u00e0-vis the council and commission, in particular in the light of the foreign policy provisions of the lisbon treaty; 134. welcomes the setting-up of the sakharov network, as announced on the 20th anniversary of the sakharov prize; believes that it should quickly decide on its operating arrangements and put in place the resources necessary to achieve its objectives; reiterates its demand that all winners of the sakharov prize and, in particular, aung san suu kyi, oswaldo jos\u00e9 pay\u00e1 sardi\u00f1as, the cuban collective damas de blanco and hu jia be given access to the european institutions; deplores the absence of any significant response to the eu's calls made to the chinese, burmese and cuban authorities to respect fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of expression and political association; * * * 135. instructs its president to forward this resolution to the council and the commission, to the governments and parliaments of the member states and of the candidate countries, to the united nations, the council of europe and the organization for security and co-operation in europe, and to the governments of the countries and territories mentioned in this resolution.
