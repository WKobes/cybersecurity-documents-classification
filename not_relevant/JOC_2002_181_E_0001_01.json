[1] com(2001)94 [2] com(2001)279 a key stage in the process of negotiation on the framework programme decisions has now been accomplished, with the first reading of the european parliament (14 november 2001) and the adoption of a common position by council (28 january 2002). the positions expressed by parliament and council on the new framework programme demonstrate a high degree of convergence, with broadly similar positions expressed on the overall budget and its breakdown, programme structure, scientific and technological priorities, and means of implementation. for its part, the commission has worked to encourage the process of convergence, in particular by modifying its framework programme proposals to take up a significant proportion of parliament's amendments [3]. it notes with satisfaction the substantial consensus on the underlying principles of the new framework programme that has been achieved through the efforts of council and parliament, in particular with respect to the priority to be given to the use of powerful new instruments, the strong focus of the thematic priorities, and the introduction of greater flexibility in the implementation of the programme. [3] com(2001)709 a sufficiently stable basis now exists for the commission to come forward with amended proposals for the specific programmes. these take up the changes in the framework programme resulting from the first reading, and set out their detailed implications as regards the research to be conducted and its means of implementation. the objective is to assist the other institutions in their examination of the specific programmes, and their further negotiations, with the aim of reaching early agreement on the framework programme, rules of participation and specific programmes. the most extensive adjustments to the commission's earlier proposals are to be found in the programme \"integrating and strengthening the european research area\", including the following: - adaptations to the structure and detailed research content of thematic priority 1 (to reflect its organisation in two sections, respectively on advanced genomics and its applications to health, and on combating major diseases) and thematic priority 6 (to reflect its organisation in three parts, respectively on sustainable energy systems, sustainable surface transport, and global change and ecosystems). more limited, but in some cases nevertheless substantial, amendments have been introduced in to the research content of other priority thematic areas. - adjustments to the initial policy-orientated research priorities under the heading \"supporting policies and anticipating scientific and technological needs\", along with some re-attribution of research activities in relation to the thematic priorities (notably as regards agriculture and marine ecosystem research). these take account of the modifications to content and the significant reduction in budget introduced following the first reading. - the description of the instruments (annex iii) has been refined and clarified, in the light of the debate leading up to the first reading. this reflects the principle of a smooth transition from \"traditional\" to \"new\" instruments in the implementation of the thematic priority areas, and the idea of a fourth instrument, in the spirit of the \"escalier d'excellence\". in implementing this specific programme, the commission proposes to be assisted by a committee of member states' representatives. the committee shall meet in different configurations, as appropriate, corresponding to the thematic priority areas of research. the modifications introduced in the programme \"structuring the european research area\" relate mainly to the mobility and infrastructure actions, where additional detail and clarity has been introduced in the mechanisms and instruments to be adopted, while also taking account of the more limited budget attributed to these actions. as regards the euratom programme on \"nuclear energy\", the main changes relate to the fission part, with the introduction of a new thematic priority on radiation protection and activities on the safety of nuclear installations. in both these programmes, the descriptions of the instruments (annex iii) have been substantially updated, in line with the programme \"integrating and strengthening the european research area\". in all cases, the budgetary allocations have been revised in conformity with the common position of the council. 2001/0122 (cns) amended proposal for a council decision adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: \u00abintegrating and strengthening the european research area\u00bb (2002-2006) the council of the european union, having regard to the treaty establishing the european community, and in particular article 166 thereof, having regard to the proposal from the commission [4] [4] oj no. having regard to the opinion of the european parliament [5] [5] oj no. having regard to the opinion of the economic and social committee [6] [6] oj no. whereas: (1) in accordance with article 166(3) of the treaty, decision no. .../../ec [7] of the european parliament and the council concerning the sixth multiannual framework programme of the european community for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the european research area (hereinafter referred to as \"the framework programme\") is to be implemented through specific programmes that define detailed rules for their implementation, fix their duration and provide for the means deemed necessary.

- systematic and co-ordinated planning and execution of research to support community policies, and to explore new and emerging scientific and technological areas, taking account of needs expressed by the relevant actors throughout the eu. - promoting the networking and joint action of national and european frameworks for research and innovation, and the opening up of national programmes, in these priority areas, including where appropriate by the use of actions under article 169 of the treaty, as well as in other areas where such action would be of benefit to the performance of europe's research base. the programme is complementary to the programme \"structuring the european research area\" and the specific programme for the jrc, and its implementation will be co-ordinated with them. international co-operation represents an important dimension of the framework programme. in this specific programme, international activities are carried out in the two forms of: - participation of researchers, teams and institutions from third countries in projects within the different thematic priority fields, related to issues arising at world level and being subjects of international efforts; - specific international co-operation activities with some groups of countries, as a support to community external relations and development aid policies. the objectives and forms of the international co-operation activities in the framework programme are described under the heading \"specific activities covering a wider field of research\". participation of the candidate countries in this programme will be encouraged. participation of small and medium sized enterprises (smes) will be encouraged and gender equity will, overall, be assured in the implementation of the activities. the activities carried out within the programme will be implemented in an integrated fashion to assure coherence and synergy between their various elements and, as appropriate, with other parts of the framework programme. 1. focusing and integrating community research 1.1. priority thematic areas of research the priority thematic areas represent the bulk of expenditure under the sixth framework programme . through a highly focused community research effort, the intention is to generate a substantial leveraging effect which, together with actions in other parts of the framework programme and through open co-ordination with other - regional, national, european and international - frameworks, will result in a coherent and highly effective common endeavour towards their overall objectives. the actions are therefore described in terms of: - the overall objectives and expected achievements which are sought in each priority area; - the research priorities to be pursued by means of community action. the priority thematic areas of research are described in terms of their overall objectives and the main research focus. the associated work programme will elaborate further on the detailed research content. within the thematic priority areas, the importance of the new instruments (integrated projects and networks of excellence) is recognised as being an overall priority means to attain the objectives of critical mass, management simplification and european added value contributed by community research in relation to what is already undertaken at national level, and of the integration of the research capacities. networks of excellence and integrated projects will be used from the start of the programme in each thematic priority area and, where deemed appropriate, as a priority means, while maintaining the use of specific targeted projects and co-ordination actions. in addition to research and technological development, they may incorporate the following types of activity, where they are of specific relevance to the objectives sought: demonstration, dissemination and exploitation; co-operation with researchers and research teams from third countries; human resource development, including the promotion of training of researchers; development of research facilities and infrastructure of specific relevance to the research being undertaken; and promotion of better links between science and society, including women in science. specific targeted research projects and co-ordination actions, giving effect to the concept of a stairway of excellence and integration, as well as specific support actions, may also be used in the implementation of the thematic priorities. innovation is an important dimension which must be taken into account in the design and implementation of rtd activities. in particular, networks of excellence and integrated projects will include activities relating to dissemination and exploitation of knowledge and, where relevant, to ensure transfer of technology and facilitate exploitation of results. where appropriate, special attention will be given to technology transfer to smes and to the creation of research - based enterprises as a means of exploiting research results. the priority research areas include, in certain cases, research at the borders of traditional disciplines where advances will require interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary effort. they will also each carry out, as appropriate, exploratory research at the leading edge of knowledge on subjects closely related to one or more topics within them. measurement and testing aspects will also receive necessary emphasis. a particular attention will be given during the implementation of the programme to the co-ordination between the different priority areas, and between these areas and actions under the heading \"supporting policies and anticipating scientific and technological needs\". the principle of sustainable development, and gender equality, will be duly taken into account. furthermore, consideration of the ethical, social, legal and wider cultural aspects of the research to be undertaken and its potential applications, as well as socio-economic impacts of scientific and technological development and foresight, will where relevant form a part of the activities under this heading. research on ethics related to scientific and technological developments will be carried out in the programme \"structuring the european research area\". during the implementation of this programme and in the research activities arising from it, fundamental ethical principles are to be respected. these include the principles set out in the charter of fundamental rights of the eu, including the following: protection of human dignity and human life, protection of personal data and privacy, as well as animals and the environment in accordance with community law and relevant international conventions and codes of conduct, e.g. the helsinki declaration in its latest version, the convention of the council of europe on human rights and biomedicine signed in oviedo on 4 april 1997, and the additional protocol on the prohibition of cloning human beings signed in paris on 12 january 1998, the un convention on the rights of the child, the universal declaration on the human genome and human rights adopted by unesco, and the relevant world health organisation (who)resolutions. account will also be taken to the opinions of the european group of advisers on the ethical implications of biotechnology ( 1991 -1997) and the opinions of the european group on ethics in science and new technologies( as from 1998) participants in research projects must conform to current legislation and regulations in the countries where the research will be carried out. where appropriate, participants in research projects must seek the approval of the relevant ethics committees prior to the start of the rtd activities. an ethical review will be implemented systematically for proposals dealing with sensitive issues. in specific cases, an ethical review may take place during the implementation of a project. the following fields of research shall not be financed under this programme: - research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes; - research activity intended to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes heritable [15]; [15] research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads can be financed. - research activities intended to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer. in accordance with the amsterdam protocol on animal protection and welfare, animal experiments must be replaced with alternatives wherever possible. suffering by animals must be avoided or kept to a minimum. this particularly applies (pursuant to directive 86/609/eec) to animal experiments involving species which are closest to human beings. altering the genetic heritage of animals and cloning of animals may be considered only if the aims are ethically justified and the conditions are such that the animals' welfare is guaranteed and the principles of biodiversity are respected. 1.1.1 genomics and biotechnology for health [16] [16] in this and other areas of activity within the framework programme, human cloning for reproductive purposes will not be supported; no research activities modifying or aiming to modify the genetic heritage of human beings will be carried out; nor will any research activity involving the creation of a human embryo for research or therapeutic purposes be carried out. as far as possible, animal experiments and testing should be replaced by in vitro or alternative methods. animal suffering must be avoided or kept to a minimum and, in this regard, special attention must be paid to animal experimentation involving species that are the closest to human beings (in accordance with directive 86/609/cee). the modification of the genetic heritage of animals and animal cloning will be envisaged only for objectives that are justified on ethical grounds and when carried out under conditions respecting animal welfare and the principles of genetic diversity. the sequencing of the human genome and many other genomes heralds a new age in human biology, offering unprecedented opportunities to improve human health and to stimulate industrial and economic activity. in making its contribution to realising these benefits, this theme will focus on integrating post-genomic research into the more established biomedical and biotechnological approaches, and will facilitate the integration of research capacities (both public and private) across europe to increase coherence and achieve critical mass. integrated multidisciplinary research, which enables a strong interaction between technology and biology, is vital in this theme for translating genome data into practical applications. in addition, an essential element will be to involve key stakeholders, for example, as appropriate industry, healthcare providers and physicians, policy makers, regulatory authorities, patient associations, and experts on ethical matters, etc in implementing the theme. gender equity in the research will also be ensured [17]. [17] causes, clinical manifestation, consequences and treatment of disease and disorders often differ between women and men. therefore, all activities funded within this thematic priority must take the possibility of gender differences into account in their research protocols, methodologies and analysis of results. this thematic priority area will stimulate and sustain multidisciplinary basic research to exploit the full potential of genome information to underpin applications to human health. the emphasis will be put on research aimed at bringing basic knowledge through to application, to enable real and consistent progress in medicine and improve the quality of life. this research may also have implications for research on areas such as agriculture and environment, which are addressed under other thematic priorities. it will be an integral component of the european community effort to enhance the european biotechnology industry in line with the conclusions of the stockholm council. it will endeavour to create strong links with all activities that improve the framework conditions for innovation in the health sector of the biotechnology industry, especially in smes, including stimulating entrepreneurship and opportunities for investment through venture capital and the involvement of the european investment bank. attention will also be paid to the identification of regulatory bottlenecks in the development of new applications for genomics, to the anticipation at the earliest possible stage of the ethical implications and to the broader implications of developments in genomics research for society and citizens. this thematic priority area will also foster the implementation and development of the health strategy of the european community. throughout the thematic priority, international collaboration will be encouraged. where appropriate, due account will be given to the european community's commitment to poverty reduction in developing countries and the importance that improved health will bring to the process - in line with article 177 of the treaty and with the european community's accelerated actions to combat hiv/aids, malaria and tuberculosis. research priorities i) advanced genomics and its applications for health fundamental knowledge and basic tools for functional genomics in all organisms the strategic objective of this line is to foster the basic understanding of genomic information, by developing the knowledge base, tools and resources needed to decipher the function of genes and gene products relevant to human health and to explore their interactions with each other and with their environment. research actions will encompass the following: - gene expression and proteomics: the objectives are to enable researchers to better decipher the functions of genes and gene products as well as to define the complex regulatory networks (biocomplexity) that control fundamental biological processes. research will focus on: developing high throughput tools and approaches for monitoring gene expression and protein profiles and for determining protein function and protein interactions. - structural genomics: the objectives are to enable researchers to determine, more effectively and at a higher rate than is currently feasible, the 3-d structure of proteins and other macromolecules, which is important for elucidating protein function and essential for drug design. research will focus on: developing high throughput approaches for determining high-resolution 3-d structures of macromolecules. - comparative genomics and population genetics: the objectives are to enable researchers to use well-characterised model organisms for predicting and testing gene function and to take full advantage of specific population cohorts available in europe to determine the relationship between gene function and health or disease. research will focus on: developing model organisms and transgenic tools; developing genetic epidemiology tools and standardised genotyping protocols. - bioinformatics: the objectives are to enable researchers to access efficient tools for managing and interpreting the ever-increasing quantities of genome data and for making it available to the research community in an accessible and usable form. research will focus on: developing bioinformatic tools and resources for data storage, mining and processing; developing computational biology approaches for in silico prediction of gene function and for the simulation of complex regulatory networks. - multidisciplinary functional genomics approaches to basic biological processes: the objectives are to enable researchers to study fundamental biological processes by integrating the above innovative approaches. research will focus on: elucidation of the mechanisms underlying fundamental cellular processes, to identify the genes involved and to decipher their biological functions in living organisms. applications of knowledge and technologies in the field of genomics and biotechnology for health the strategic objective of this line is to foster the competitiveness of europe's biotechnology industry by exploiting the wealth of biological data produced by genomics and advances in biotechnology. research actions will encompass the following: - technological platforms for thedevelopments in the fields of new diagnostic, prevention and therapeutic tools: the objectives are to foster academic and industrial collaboration through technological platforms where multidisciplinary approaches using cutting edge technologies arising from genomic research may contribute to health care progress and cost reduction through more precise diagnosis, individualised treatment and more efficient development pathways for new drugs and therapies, and other novel products of the new technologies. research will focus on: rational and accelerated development of new, safer, more effective drugs including pharmacogenomics approaches; development of new diagnostics; development of new in vitro tests to replace animal experimentation; development and testing of new preventive and therapeutic tools, such as somatic gene and cell therapies ( in particular stem cell therapies) and immunotherapies; innovative research in post-genomics, which has high potential for application. with a view to ensuring socially responsible choices, public acceptance and an efficient development pathway for these new technologies, an active and early involvement in the above activities of regulators, experts on ethics, patients and society at large will be necessary. ii) combating major diseases application-oriented genomic approaches to medical knowledge and technologies the strategic objective of this line is to develop improved strategies for the prevention and management of human disease and for living and ageing healthily. it will concentrate exclusively on integrating genomic approach through all relevant organisms into more established medical approaches for investigating disease and health determinants. the emphasis will be put on translational research aimed at bringing basic knowledge through to clinical application. research actions will focus on the following: - combating , cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and rare diseases: the objectives are to improve the prevention and management of important causes of mortality and ill health in europe and to pool europe's research resources for tackling rare diseases. research will focus on: integrating clinical expertise and resources with relevant model systems and advanced tools in functional genomics to generate breakthroughs in the prevention and management of these diseases. - combating resistance to antibiotics and other drugs: the objectives are to confront the major threat to public health caused by drug resistant pathogens. research will focus on: exploitation of the knowledge of microbial genomes and on host-pathogen interactions for the development of vaccines and alternative therapeutic strategies to circumvent the problem of antimicrobial and other drug resistance; development of strategies for optimal usage of antimicrobials; support to the european community network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases. - studying the brain and combating diseases of the nervous system: the objectives are to use genome information to understand better the functioning and dysfunctioning of the brain, in order to gain new insight into mental processes, to combat neurological disorders and diseases, and to improve brain repair. research will focus on: understanding the molecular and cellular bases of brain function, damage, plasticity and repair, learning, memory and cognition; developing strategies for prevention and management of neurological and mental disorders and diseases. - studying human development and the ageing process: the objective is to better understand human development, with special emphasis on the ageing process, in order to develop the evidence base for improving public health strategies to promote healthy living and healthy ageing. research will focus on: understanding human development from conception to adolescence; exploring the molecular and cellular determinants of healthy ageing including their interactions with environmental, behavioural and gender factors. combating cancer the objective is to develop improved patient-oriented strategies, from prevention to diagnosis and treatment, for combating cancer. the research will therefore concentrate on translating the new knowledge being created by genomics and other fields of basic research into applications that improve clinical practice and public health. the patient-oriented approach will include three interlinked components. research will focus on : - establishing facilities for the exploitation of research on cancer in europe; encouraging the development of evidence-based guidelines for good clinical practice and improved public health strategies by accelerating the translation of existing research results into applications. -

this was emphasised by the recent european council in g\u00f6teborg. in this context, global change, energy security , sustainable transport, sustainable management of europe's natural resources, and their interaction with human activities motivate this research priority theme. the activities carried out within this priority aim at strengthening the scientific and technological capacities needed for europe to be able to implement a sustainable development model in the short and in the long term, integrating its social, economic and environmental dimensions, and make a significant contribution to the international efforts to mitigate or even to reverse current adverse trends, to understand and control global change and preserve the equilibrium of ecosystems. 1.1.6.1 sustainable energy systems strategic objectives address the reduction of greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions, the security of energy supply, the increased use of renewable energy as well as to achieve an enhanced competitiveness of european industry. achieving these objectives in the short term requires a large-scale research effort to encourage the deployment of technologies already under development and to help promote changes in energy demand patterns and consumption behaviour by improving energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy into the energy system. . the longer term implementation of sustainable development requires also an important rtd effort to assure the economically attractive availability, of energy, and overcome the potential barriers to adoption of renewable energy sources and new carriers and technologies such as hydrogen and fuel cells that are intrinsically clean. research priorities i) research activities having an impact in the short and medium term community rtd activity is one of the main instruments which can serve to support the implementation of new legislative instruments in the field of energy and to change significantly current unsustainable patterns of development, which are characterised by growing dependence on imported fossil fuels, continually rising energy demand, increasing congestion of the transport systems, and growing co2 emissions, by offering new technological solution which could positively influence consumer/user behaviour, especially in the urban environment . the goal is to bring innovative and cost competitive technological solutions to the market as quickly as possible through demonstration and other research actions aiming at the market, which involve consumers / users in pilot environments, and which address not only technical but also organisational, institutional, financial and social issues. - clean energy, in particular renewable energy sources and their integration in the energy system, including storage, distribution and use. the aim is to bring to the market improved renewable energy technologies and to integrate renewable energy into networks and supply chains, for example by supporting stakeholders who are committed to establishing \"sustainable communities\" employing a high percentage of renewable energy supplies. such actions will adopt innovative or improved technical and/or socio-economic approaches to \"green electricity\", heat, or biofuels and their integration into energy distribution networks or supply chains, including combinations with conventional large scale energy distribution. research will focus on: increased cost effectiveness, performance and reliability of the main new and renewable energy sources; integration of renewable energy and effective combination of decentralised sources, with cleaner conventional large-scale generation; validation of new concepts for energy storage, distribution and use. - energy savings and energy efficiency, including those to be achieved through the use of renewable raw materials. the overall objective is to reduce the demand for energy by 18% by the year 2010 in order to contribute to meeting the eu's commitments to combat climate change and to improve the security of energy supply. research activities will focus in particular on eco-buildings to generate energy savings and improve environmental quality as well as quality of life for occupants. \"polygeneration\" activities will contribute to the community target of doubling the share of cogeneration (chp) in eu electricity generation from 9% to 18% by 2010, and improve the efficiency of combined production of electricity, heating and cooling services, by using new technologies such as fuel cells and integrate renewable energy sources. research will focus on: improving savings and efficiency mainly in the urban context, in particular in buildings, through the optimisation and validation of new concepts and technologies, including combined heat and power and district heating/cooling systems; opportunities offered by on-site production and use of renewable energy to improve energy efficiency in buildings. - alternative motor fuels. the commission has set an ambitious target of 20% substitution of diesel and gasoline fuels by alternative fuels in the road transport sector by the year 2020. the aim is to improve the security of energy supply through reduced dependence on imported liquid hydrocarbons and to address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from transport. in line with the communication on alternative fuels for road transportation, short term rtd will concentrate on three types of alternative motor fuels that potentially could reach a significant market share: biofuels, natural gas and hydrogen. research will focus on: the integration of alternative motor fuels into the transport system, particularly into clean urban transport; the cost-effective and safe production, storage, and distribution (including fuelling infrastructure) of alternative motor fuels; the optimal utilisation of alternative fuels in new concepts of energy efficient vehicles; strategies and tools to manage the market transformation process for alternative motor fuels. ii) research activities having an impact in the medium and longer term in the medium and longer term the objective is to develop new and renewable energy sources, and new carriers such as hydrogen which are both affordable and clean and which can be well integrated in a long term sustainable energy supply and demand context both for stationary and for transport applications. furthermore the continuing use of fossil fuels in the foreseeable future requires cost-effective solutions to the disposal of co2. the goal is to bring about further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions beyond the kyoto deadline of 2010. the future large-scale development of these technologies will depend on significant improvement in their cost and other aspects of competitiveness , within the overall socio-economic and institutional context in which they are deployed. - fuel cells, including their applications: these represent an emerging technology which is expected, in the longer term, to replace a large part of the current combustion systems in industry, buildings and road transport, as they have a higher efficiency, lower pollution levels and a potential for lower cost. the long term cost target is 50 euro/kw for road transport and 300 euro/kw for high-durability stationary applications and fuel cell/electrolysers. research will focus on: cost reduction in fuel cell production and in applications for buildings, transport and de-centralised electricity production; advanced materials related to low and high temperature fuel cells for the above applications. - new technologies for energy carriers/transport and storage, in particular hydrogen: the aim is to develop new concepts for long term sustainable energy supply where hydrogen and clean electricity are seen as major energy carriers. for h2, the means must be developed to ensure its safe use at an equivalent cost to that of conventional fuels. for electricity, decentralised new and in particular renewable energy resources, must be optimally integrated, within inter-connected european, regional and local distribution networks to provide secure and reliable high quality supply. research will focus on : clean cost-effective production of hydrogen ; hydrogen infrastructure including transport, distribution, storage and utilisation; for electricity the focus will be on new concepts, for analysis, planning, control and supervision of electricity supply and distribution and on enabling technologies, for storage, interactive transmission and distribution networks. new and advanced concepts in renewable energy technologies:renewable energy technologies focus will be on technologies with a significant future energy potential and requiring long-term research, by means of actions with high european added value in particular and to make these technologiesresearch will focus on : for photovoltaics : the whole production chain from basic material to the pv system, as well as on the integration of pv in habitat and large scale mw-size pv systems for production of electricity. for biomass barriers in the biomass supply-use chain will be addressed in the following areas: production, combustion technologies, gasification technologies for electricity and h2/syngas production and biofuels for transport. for other areas the effort will be focused on integrating at european level specific aspects of rtd activities which require long term research. - capture and sequestration of co2, associated with cleaner fossil fuel plants: cost effective capture and sequestration of co2 is essential to include the use of fossil fuels in a sustainable energy supply scenario, reducing costs to the order of 30eur in the medium term and 20eur or less in the longer term per tonne of co2 for capture rates above 90%. research will focus on : developing holistic approaches to near zero emission fossil fuel based energy conversion systems, low cost co2 separation systems, both pre-combustion and post-combustion as well as oxyfuel and novel concepts: development of safe, cost efficient and environmentally compatible co2 disposal options, in particular geological storage, and exploratory actions for assessing the potential of chemical storage. 1.1.6.2 sustainable surface transport the white paper: \"european transport policy for 2010: time to decide\" forecasts a transport demand growth by 2010 in the european union of 38% for freight and 24% for passenger transport (base-year 1998). the already congested transport networks will have to absorb the additional traffic, and the trend suggests that the proportion absorbed by the less sustainable modes is likely to grow. the objective is consequently both to fight against congestion and to decelerate or even reverse thesetrends regarding the modal split by better integrating and rebalancing the different transport modes, improving their safety, performance and efficiency, minimising their impact on the environment and ensuring the development of a genuinely sustainable european transport system, while supporting european industry's competitiveness in the production and operation of transport means and systems. research priorities: i) developing environmentally friendly transport systems and means of transport. the objective is to reduce the contribution of surface transport (rail, road, waterborne) to co2 production and other emissions including noise, while increasing safety, comfort, quality, cost-effectiveness and energy-efficiency of vehicles and vessels. emphasis will be given to clean urban transport and rational use of the car in the city. - new technologies and concepts for all surface transport modes (road, rail and waterborne). research will focus on: high efficiency propulsion systems and their components, based on alternative and renewable fuels, taking into account the fuelling infrastructure;

- to explore new and emerging scientific and technological problems and opportunities, including in particular interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research areas, where european action is appropriate in view of the potential to develop strategic positions at the leading edge of knowledge and in new markets, or to anticipate major issues facing european society. a feature common to these activities is that they will be implemented within a multi-annual perspective which takes direct account of the needs and viewpoints of the main associated actors (as appropriate: policymakers, industrial user groups, leading edge research groups, etc.) they will be implemented in conjunction with a flexible programming mechanism to be implemented during the course of the programme, by which specific priorities, corresponding to identified needs and falling within the objectives indicated above, will be determined. priorities thus determined will then be inscribed in the workprogramme for the specific programme, alongside the priorities deriving from objectives in other parts of the programme, and updated regularly. this will result in a progressive allocation of the budget relating to these activities to the specific priorities identified, throughout the period of execution. the programming will be carried out by the commission, and will be based on suggestions received in response to a wide-ranging consultation of interested circles in the eu and the countries associated with the framework programme, regarding the topics to be included. a first allocation of euro 350 million will be made to the research activities specified below, which have been determined on the basis of needs which can be identified now; ; the remaining eur 220 million will be allocated during the course of implementation of the specific programme. i) policy-orientated research the activities under this heading will provide, in particular, support for: - the common agricultural policy (cap), and the common fisheries policy (cfp); - sustainable development, in particular the community policy objectives relating to environment (including those set out in the 6th environment action programme [20]); energy (the green paper \"towards a european strategy for the security of energy supply\" [21]); and transport (the white paper on european transport policy [22]); [20] com(2001)31. [21] com(2000)769.

community policy objectives deriving from the political orientations given by the european council, with regard to, for instance, economic policy, the information society, as well as e-europe, and enterprise. they may include pre-normative research, measurement and testing where necessary for the needs of community policies. multi-annual programming the multi-annual programming of these activities will take into account the opinions of the relevant scientific committees associated with the policies concerned. the programming will be conducted with the help of a user group composed of different commission services, who will also have recourse, where appropriate, to an independent consultation structure composed of high-level scientific and industrial experts. the user group will assess suggestions put forward regarding the topics to be included on the basis of the following criteria: - their contribution to policy formulation and development (e.g. links with legislative proposals in preparation or with major deadlines in the area); - their potential contribution to the eu's competitiveness, the strengthening of its scientific and technological bases and the achievement of the european research area, including the effective integration of the candidate countries. - european added value, taking account in particular of research carried out in the member states in the relevant fields; - the scientific relevance and feasibility of the research themes and approaches proposed; - assurance of an appropriate division of tasks, and synergy, between these activities and the direct actions of the joint research centre in support of community policies. the programming may be altered by means of an emergency procedure based on the same evaluation criteria in the event of a crisis giving rise to urgent and unforeseen research needs. initial research priorities policy-orientated research priorities responding to immediate needs are based on suggestions for topics made by the commission's policy services, drawing on the advice, as appropriate, of the relevant scientific committees, as well as the broader objectives of the union as set out in successive conclusions of the meetings of the european council. they have been grouped within the following lines of action, in a structure which optimises synergies between different policy requirements and scientific inputs, and which cuts across and complements the thematic priorities: - sustainable management of europe's natural resources. research under this heading responds to policy requirements relating, in particular, to the modernisation and sustainability of the common agriculture and fisheries policies and the promotion of rural development, including forestry. it will focus on: the modernisation and sustainability of agriculture and forestry, including their multifunctional role in order to ensure the sustainable development and promotion of rural areas; tools and assessment methods for sustainable agriculture and forestry management; the modernisation and sustainability of fisheries policy, including aquaculture-based production systems; new and more environment friendly production methods to improve animal health and welfare; environmental assessment (soil, water, air, noise, including the effects of chemical substances). - providing health, security and opportunity to the people of europe. research in this category responds to policy requirements relating, in particular, to the implementation of the european social agenda including future social policy issues, public health and consumer protection and the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. it will focus on: health determinants and the provision of high quality and sustainable health care services and pension systems (in particular in the context of ageing and demographic change); public health issues, including epidemiology contributing to disease prevention and responses to emerging rare and communicable diseases, allergies, procedures for secure blood and organ donations, non-animal test methods; the impact of environmental issues on health (including methods for risk assessment and the mitigation of risks of natural disasters to people); issues relating to handicapped/disabled people (including equal access facilities) understanding of migration and refugee flows; understanding crime trends in the context of public safety; issues related to civil protection, including biosecurity, and crisis management. - underpinning the economic potential and cohesion of a larger and more integrated european union. research in this category responds, in particular, to the needs of a series of policies concerned with the competitiveness, dynamism and integration of the european economy, in the context of enlargement, globalisation and europe's commercial relations with the rest of the world. it will focus on: underpinning european integration, sustainable development, competitiveness and trade policies (including improved means to assess economic development and cohesion); the development of tools , indicators and operational parameters for assessing sustainable transport and energy systems performance (economic, environmental and social); global security analysis and validation systems for transport and research relating to accident risks and safety in mobility systems; forecasting and developing innovative policies for sustainability in the medium and long term; information society issues (such as management and protection of digital assets, and inclusive access to the information society); the protection of cultural heritage; improved quality, accessibility and dissemination of european statistics a co-ordinated approach will be ensured when addressing research questions that are common to different policy areas, in particular with respect to the measurement and impact assessment of demographic changes and more broadly in the development of policy-relevant statistics and indicators. ii) research to explore new and emerging scientific and technological problems and opportunities research under this heading will respond to needs in new areas which fall within the legitimate scope of community research and which cut across or lie outside the thematic priority areas, in particular because they are highly interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary. the research will also respond to unexpected major developments. by bringing together resources from across the eu, it will aim to put european research in a leading position, opening the way or creating new scientific and technological developments. it will stimulate the flow of ideas between academia and industry, and allow europe better to exploit its research assets in the drive towards a dynamic knowledge-based society. the following areas of activity will be supported initially: - research to assess rapidly new discoveries, or newly-observed phenomena, which may indicate emerging risks or problems of high importance to european society, and identify appropriate responses to them. - research in emerging areas of knowledge and on future technologies, in particular in transdisciplinary fields, which is highly innovative and involves correspondingly high (technical) risks. it will be open to any new idea that has significant potential for major industrial and/or social impact, or for the development of europe's research capabilities in the longer term. proposals will be evaluated on the basis of research excellence, potential for future impact, and, in the first of these areas particularly, innovativeness. multi-annual programming specific topics within the above categories on which research will be focused during the implementation of the programme will be selected by means of the multi-annual programming on the basis of their urgency or potential for future societal, industrial, or economic relevance, taking account of the ongoing research activities under this heading. the assessment of topics will be carried out with the support of an independent consultation structure composed of high-level scientific and industrial experts and will also incorporate the following criteria: - the potential contribution of the research topics proposed for innovation and the eu's competitiveness, the strengthening of its scientific and technological bases and the achievement of the european research area, including the effective integration of the candidate countries; - the scientific relevance and timeliness of the research themes and approaches proposed. the programming may be altered by means of an emergency procedure based on the same evaluation criteria in the event of a crisis giving rise to urgent and unforeseen research needs. iii) implementation the activities programmed will be carried out by means of calls for proposals. they will essentially take the form of: - specific targeted research projects generally of a limited scale, carried out by means of partnerships of a size adapted to the needs to be covered. - co-ordination actions, and the networking of research activities carried out at national level where the objectives can be achieved by mobilising capacities existing in the member states, candidate countries and other associated states. in certain duly justified cases, where the objectives pursued can be better attained in this way, limited use may be made of networks of excellence and integrated projects . the proposals will be selected by the commission following evaluation by independent experts. specific support actions may also be used to implement these activities. 1.2.2. horizontal research activities involving smesobjectives small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) play a crucial role in european competitiveness and job creation, not only because they represent the overwhelming majority of enterprises in europe, but also because they are the source of dynamism and change in new markets, particularly those at the leading edge of technology. although a heterogeneous community, they are all confronted by increased competition resulting from the completion of the european internal market and the need to innovate constantly and accommodate advances in technology. besides this, an increasing number of smes both need and want to internationalise in search of new markets and business opportunities. smes will participate, for the most part, in the activities implemented under the priority thematic areas of research within networks of excellence, integrated projects and specific targeted research projects. in addition, specific schemes for smes in the form of actions on collective and cooperative research will be set up. these will be addressing primarily the large community of smes with a capacity to innovate but with limited research capability. however, the co-operative research scheme will also allow innovative smes to co-operate with universities and research centres overall, in addition to the horizontal activities for smes, at least 15% of the budget relating to the seven thematic priorities under this programme will be allocated to smes. collective research collective research is a form of research undertaken by rtd performers on behalf of industrial associations or industry groupings in order to expand the knowledge base of large communities of smes and thus improve their general standard of competitiveness. conducted on a european basis, through substantial projects of several years duration, this is an efficient way of addressing technological needs of significant sections of the industrial community. based on schemes existing in many member states, this measure aims at allowing industrial groupings to identify and express research needs that are common to large numbers of smes at european level. it should allow to improve the overall european technological basis of whole industrial sectors. by inter-linking industrial groupings in different countries and in financing larger projects with an increased responsibility for project co-ordinators, it will contribute to structuring the landscape of collective research in line with the objectives of the european research area. collective research projects could cover, for example : - research aimed at addressing common problems/challenges (e.g. to meet regulatory requirements, environmental performance) - pre-normative research (research to provide a scientific base for european norms and standards) - research aimed at reinforcing the technological basis of particular sector(s) - development of \"technological tools\" (e.g. diagnosis, safety equipment) projects will be managed, on the basis of well-defined guidelines, by industrial associations or other groupings established at european level, or by at least 2 national industrial associations/groupings established in different european countries. european economic interest groups representing the interests of smes are also eligible. a \"core group\" of smes associated to each project will monitor progress from the definition phase of the research to the dissemination of the results obtained. a 2-step approach is envisaged in identifying topics and selecting proposals (call for outline proposals and, after those selected in a first round evaluation have been developed into complete proposal(s), evaluation and selection from amongst these). the level of funding and contractual arrangements of collective research projects will depend on their objectives: - projects aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of a specific industrial sector would benefit from a maximum community contribution of 50% of the total eligible costs. in such cases the contracting party (the industrial groupings) would own the results. - projects having a strong legislative or \"public well-being\" content (e.g. environmental protection, enhancement of public health), could obtain a higher funding. in such cases, the main emphasis will be on a europe-wide dissemination of the research results. in all cases, dissemination of the results amongst the smes would be foreseen through, for example, special training and demonstration (\"take-up\") actions. co-operative research co-operative research is a scheme whereby a limited number of smes from different countries having specific problems or needs, outsource the required research to an rtd performer, while retaining ownership of the results. projects are relatively short term and may address any research topic or field, being based on the specific needs and problems of the smes concerned. other (non-sme) enterprises and end-users will be able to participate in co-operative research projects, under conditions ensuring they do not assume a dominant role, and have restricted access to the results. these activities may also be carried out by innovative and high-tech smes in co-operation with research centres and universities. co-operative research will be implemented via an open call for proposals. information and advice about the possibilities of sme involvement will be ensured via entry points set up by the commission, and by making use of the national contact point scheme. this activity will also be responsible for the co-ordination of a dedicated network of sme national contact points in the member states and associated states, providing smes at regional and national level with information and assistance on their participation in the framework programme, including in networks of excellence and integrated projects. close co-ordination with the economic and technological intelligence actions and with the innovation support services, implemented under the heading \"research and innovation\", will ensure that smes benefit from all the foreseen instruments and activities. 1.2.3. specific measures in support of international co-operationthe general objective of the international cooperation activities carried out under the framework programme is to help open up the european research area to the rest of the world. these activities represent the particular contribution of the framework programme to this opening-up process, which will require a joint effort by the community and the member states. under this heading, the activities in question have the following particular objectives: - to help european researchers, businesses and research organisations in the eu and the countries associated with the framework programme to have access to knowledge and expertise existing elsewhere in the world. - to help ensure europe's strong and coherent participation in the research initiatives conducted at international level in order to push back the boundaries of knowledge or help to resolve the major global issues, for example as regards health and environment. - to lend support, in the scientific and technological field, to the implementation of the community's foreign policy and development aid policy. apart from opening up the activities of the seven thematic priorities to participation by third-country researchers and institutions, international cooperation activities will take the form of specific activities. carried out in support of the community's foreign policy and development aid policy, these specific activities will concern three groups of countries: the mediterranean third countries, russia and the cis countries, and the developing countries. they will be carried out in such a way as to complement the participation of researchers and entities in those countries in the networks of excellence and integrated projects which are open to them and in which they will participate in a variable way depending on the themes and countries. the research priorities in this category of activities are defined on the basis of the interests and objectives of the community's political partnership with the different groups of countries, as well as their particular economic and social needs. they will therefore cover more particularly: - in the case of the mediterranean third countries, in support of the development of the euro-mediterranean partnership, issues relating to environment, health and water issues, as well as protection of the cultural heritage. - in the case of russia and the cis countries, stabilisation of r&d potential, issues relating to changes in the industrial production system, environment and health protection and various safety aspects. - in the case of the developing countries, the problems of health and public health, food security , and the rational exploitation of resources. these activities will be carried out by means of research, technological development and demonstration projects of a limited scale, actions to coordinate national efforts and, where necessary, specific support measures. cooperation activities with russia and the cis will be carried out in particular through the intas structure set up jointly by the community and the member states. in all three cases, one of the major objectives is to help strengthen, stabilise, develop or adapt the local research systems. accordingly, the framework programme activities will endeavour to strengthen coordination and complementarity with activities carried out by means of financial instruments such as, in the case of the mediterranean third countries, the meda programme, in the case of russia and the cis countries the tacis programme and in the case of the developing countries the edf (european development fund) and the ala (latin america/asia) fund. these activities can help to promote the development in those countries of human resources for research, research infrastructures and capabilities relating to innovation and exploitation of results. 2. strengthening the foundations of the european research area the establishment of the european research area depends on improving the coherence and co-ordination of research and innovation activities and policies conducted at national, regional and european level. the objectives of community action in this field are to stimulate and support programme coordination and joint actions conducted at national or regional level as well as among european organisations and thus help to develop the common knowledge base necessary for the coherent development of policies. the activities may be implemented in any scientific and technological area, including in the thematic priority domains. 2.1 support for the co-ordination of activities coordination of national activities the objective is to encourage and support initiatives undertaken by several countries, in areas of common strategic interest, to develop synergy between their existing activities through coordination of their implementation, mutual opening and mutual access to research results, as well as to define and implement joint activities. the activities concerned must be understood as programmes or parts of programmes, instruments, plans or other initiatives undertaken at national or regional levels and involving public funding to support rtd work, the development of research capabilities, and the promotion of innovation. the activities may be undertaken directly by public authorities or research agencies at national or regional levels or through european co-operation frameworks, in particular the eurocores collaborative scheme of the european science foundation. efforts to encourage co-ordination activities, using a bottom-up approach, will be carried out in the whole field of science and technology in areas such as : - health: health of key population groups ; major diseases and disorders (e.g. cancer diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hepatitis, visual impairment), rare diseases and major diseases linked to poverty in developing countries; activities involved will be implemented, for instance, through coordination of research and comparative studies, development of european databases and interdisciplinary networks, exchange of clinical practice and coordination of clinical trials. - biotechnology: non-health and non-food applications. - environment: urban environment (including sustainable urban development and cultural heritage, including, for example, ecosite concepts); marine environment and land/soil management; seismic risk; - energy: new generation power plants (\"near-zero-emission\"), energy storage, transport and distribution. the community will encourage and support initiatives aimed at networking national and regional activities and programmes, by supporting: - the coordination of independent activities including their mutual opening; - the preparation and the management of joint activities. for this purpose, the community will : - support proposals selected following their submission in response to an open call for proposals (2 evaluations per year). where appropriate, calls for expressions of interest, followed by targeted calls may be published. proposals may cover for instance strategic studies and planning, consultation of the research and innovation community, joint calls for proposals and peer review panels, exchange and dissemination of information and results, programme monitoring and evaluation, exchange of personnel. proposals will be evaluated taking into account in particular the following aspects: the scope of the resources mobilised, the scientific and technological relevance and impact, the expected improvement in the use of research resources at european level and where appropriate their contribution to promoting innovation. - develop an integrated information system, which will be easily accessible, user-friendly and updated regularly, to provide relevant information to: - policy makers and programme managers: information on national and regional research programmes, instruments, research activities undertaken and planned to help identify opportunities for co-ordination, networking or joint initiatives; - the research community: information on national, regional or joint programmes in which they can participate. co-ordination at european level the objective is to enhance the complementarity and synergy between community actions undertaken under the framework programme and those of other european scientific co-operation organisations as well as among these organisations themselves. through increased co-ordination and collaboration the various european co-operation frameworks will contribute more effectively to the overall coherence of european research efforts and the establishment of a european research area. community participation in international activities can be supported in duly justified cases. - scientific and technological co-operation activities carried out in other european co-operation frameworks cost is a long-standing bottom-up mechanism that facilitates co-ordination and exchanges between nationally funded scientists and research teams in a variety of areas. in order for cost to continue to ensure a cost-effective contribution to research co-ordination within the european research area, its management arrangements must be adapted to the new context. this will entail the establishment by cost member states of an appropriate organisation to which financial support may then be granted under this programme. reinforced co-ordination among the activities of the european science foundation, cost and the framework programme will also be sought in areas of common interest. coordination with eureka will be strengthened to improve strategic coherence and complementarity of funding, in particular in the thematic priority areas. joint information and communication actions will also be organised where appropriate. - collaboration and joint initiatives of specialised european scientific cooperation organisations with regard to thematic european organisations, such as cern, esa, eso, embl, esrf, ill, the community will encourage and support specific initiatives aiming at strengthening the coherence and synergies between their activities and between them and community actions, in particular through the development of joint approaches and actions on issues of common interest. 2.2 coherent development of research and innovation policies the objective of the activities to be carried out in this area is to encourage the coherent development of research and innovation policies in europe thanks to the early identification of challenges and areas of common interest as well as by providing national, regional and community policymakers with knowledge and decision-aiding tools that can help them formulate policy. the activities to be carried out to this end will take place in the following areas: - analyses and studies; work relating to foresight, statistics and science and technology indicators these activities will include studies, analyses and foresight activities relating to scientific and technological activities and research and innovation policies in the context of the implementation of the european research area. the activities relating to foresight will include in particular the development of thematic dialogue platforms and a knowledge base for users and producers of prospective analyses, the exploitation of good practices with regard to methodology, as well as the preparation of medium and long term scenarios for science and technology in europe. work on indicators will involve the further development of relevant and harmonised indicators, taking into account the different dimensions of research and innovation and their impact on economy and society, for example for comparing the scientific and technological performance of the member states and regions. - benchmarking of research and innovation policies at national, regional and european level the first exercise to benchmark national rtd policies, which began in 2000, will be completed by mid 2002. in the light of this exercise, the methodology of the next benchmarking cycles, including the indicators, will be adapted and the exercises will be enlarged geographically by opening them up to the countries in the process of acceding to the eu and the associated countries, and will be extended to include other themes. special attention will be paid to the dissemination and monitoring of the application of best practices in close collaboration with the member states and the research actors. the benchmarking work in progress in the field of innovation (gathering of information about innovation policies in europe, development of the \"innovation scoreboard\" and organisation of \"peer reviews\" of innovation policies by \"thematic clubs\" of policymakers) will be extended so as to open them up geographically, in social terms as a result of involving the innovation stakeholders, and in regional terms. - mapping scientific and technological excellence in europe the activities on mapping excellence will be expanded according to two guidelines, increasing the number of themes covered and regularly updating the results. special attention will be paid to the very broad dissemination of the information available as well as to the coordination of mapping with the activities aimed at promoting the integration of research efforts in europe. - improving the regulatory and administrative environment for research and innovation in europe the objective here is to examine and analyse regulatory and administrative obstacles, to identify and disseminate good management practices and to help formulate new approaches. the following are some of the areas that will be concerned: intellectual and industrial property; public-private relations with regard to research and innovation; the exploitation and dissemination of knowledge; the rules governing access to new products or services on the market; mechanisms for funding research and innovation and encouraging investment, in particular by the private sector. annex ii indicative breakdown of the amount &gt;table position&gt; annex iii - means for implementing the programme in order to implement the specific programme, and in accordance with the decisions of the european parliament and of the council concerning the multiannual framework programme 2002-2006 of the european community for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the european research area (2002/.../ec) and with the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results (2002/.../ec), the commission will use various instruments. as regards the thematic priority areas, the importance of the new instruments (integrated projects and networks of excellence) is recognised as being an overall priority means to attain the objectives of critical mass, management simplification and european added value contributed by community research in relation to what is already undertaken at national level, and of the integration of the research capacities. however, the size of projects is not a criterion for exclusion, and access to new instruments is ensured for smes and other small entities. the new instruments will be used from the start of the sixth framework programme in each theme and, where deemed appropriate, as a priority means, while maintaining the use of specific targeted projects and coordination actions. the commission will evaluate the proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the above mentioned decisions . the community contribution will be granted in accordance with the above mentioned decisions and in compliance with the community framework for state aid for research. in the case of participation of bodies from regions lagging in development, when a project receives the maximum intensity of co-financing authorised under the framework programme or an overall grant, an additional contribution from the structural funds, pursuant to council regulation (ec) no 1260/99, [26] could be granted. [26] oj l 161, 26.6.99. in the case of participation of entities from the associated candidate countries, an additional contribution from the pre-accession financial instruments could be granted under similar conditions. in the case of participation of organisations from mediterranean or developing countries, a contribution of the meda programme and of the financial instruments of the community's aid to development could be envisaged. in carrying out the programme, the commission may have recourse to technical assistance. in 2004 an evaluation will be undertaken by independent experts of the efficiency of each of these three types of instruments in the execution of the sixth framework programme. actions under articles 169 and 171 of the treaty which contribute to the scientific and technological objectives set out in annex i may be supported financially by the specific programme, in accordance with the relevant decisions under article 172 of the treaty. a. new instruments a.1 networks of excellence networks of excellence are implemented in the seven priority thematic areas of the framework programme and, in duly justified cases, the purpose of networks of excellence is to strengthen and develop community scientific and technological excellence by means of the integration, at european level, of research capacities currently existing or emerging at both national and regional level. each network will also aim at advancing knowledge in a particular area by assembling a critical mass of expertise. they will foster cooperation between capacities of excellence in universities, research centres, enterprises, including smes, and science and technology organisations. the activities concerned will be generally targeted towards long-term, multidisciplinary objectives, rather than predefined results in terms of products, processes or services. a network of excellence will be implemented by a joint programme of activities involving some or, where appropriate, all of the research capacities and activities of the participants in the relevant area to attain a critical mass of expertise and european added value. a joint programme of activities could aim at the creation of a self-standing virtual centre of excellence that may result in developing the necessary means for achieving a durable integration of the research capacities. a joint programme of activities will necessarily include those aimed at integration, as well as activities related to the spreading of excellence and dissemination of results outside the network. in pursuing its objectives, the network will therefore carry out: - research activities integrated by its participants - integration activities which will comprise in particular: - adaptation of the participants' research activities in order to strengthen their complementarity; - development and utilisation of electronic information and communication means, and development of virtual and interactive working methods; - short-, medium- and long-term exchanges of personnel, the opening of positions to researchers from other members of the network, or their training; - development and use of joint research infrastructures, and adaptation of the existing facilities with a view to a shared use; - joint management and exploitation of the knowledge generated, and actions to promote innovation. - activities of spreading of excellence which will comprise, as appropriate: - training of researchers; - communication concerning the achievements of the network and the dissemination of knowledge; - services in support of technological innovation in smes, aimed in particular at the take-up of new technologies; - analyses of science/society issues related to the research carried out by the network. in carrying out some of its activities (such as training of researchers), the network will endeavour to ensure publicity by publishing calls for applications. the size of the network may vary according to the areas and subjects involved. as an indication, the number of participants should not be less than half a dozen. on average, in financial terms, the community contribution to a network of excellence may represent several million euros per year. the network proposals should comprise the following elements: - a general outline of the joint programme of activities, and its content for the first period, broken down into research activities, integration activities, and activities for spreading excellence; - the role of the participants, identifying the activities and resources that they will integrate; - the operation of the network (coordination and management of activities); - the plan for the dissemination of knowledge and the perspectives as regards exploitation of the results. the partnership may evolve when necessary, within the limit of the initial community contribution, by replacing participants or adding new ones. in most cases, this will be done through publication of a competitive call . the programme of activities would be updated yearly and would entail a reorientation of certain activities or launching of new ones not initially foreseen, which could involve new participants. the commission may launch calls for proposals with a view to the allocation of additional contribution in order to cover, for example, an extension of the integrated activities of the existing network or the integration of new participants. the community's financial contribution shall take the form of a grant for integration, the amount of which is determined in relation to the value of the capacities and resources which all the participants propose to integrate. it shall complement the resources deployed by the participants in order to carry out the joint programme of activities. it should be sufficient to act as an incentive for integration, but without creating a financial dependence that might jeopardise the lasting association of the network. a.2 integrated projects integrated projects will be implemented in the seven priority thematic areas of the framework programme and, in duly justified cases, in , integrated projects are designed to give increased impetus to the community's competitiveness or to address major societal needs by mobilising a critical mass of research and technological development resources and competence. each integrated project will be assigned clearly defined scientific and technological objectives and should be directed at obtaining specific results applicable in terms of, for instance, products, processes or services. under these objectives they may include more long-term or \"risky\" research. integrated projects will comprise a coherent set of component actions which may vary in size and structure according to the tasks to be carried out, each dealing with different aspects of the research needed to achieve common overall objectives, and forming a coherent whole and implemented in close coordination. they will be carried out on the basis of overall financing plans preferably involving significant mobilisation of public and private sector funding, including funding from eib and collaboration schemes such as eureka. all the activities carried out in the context of an integrated project will be defined in the general framework of an \" implementation plan\" comprising activities relating to: - research, and as appropriate technological development and/or demonstration; - management, dissemination and transfer of knowledge with a view to promoting innovation; - analysis and assessment of the technologies concerned, as well as the factors relating to their exploitation. in pursuit of its objectives, it may also comprise activities relating to: - training researchers, students, engineers and industrial executives, in particular for smes; - support for the take-up of new technologies, in particular by smes; - information and communication, and dialogue with the public concerning the science/society aspects of the research carried out within the project. the combined activities of an integrated project may represent a financial size ranging from several million euros to several tens of millions of euros. however, the size of projects is not a criterion for exclusion, and access to new instruments is ensured for smes and other small entities. integrated project proposals should comprise the following elements: - the scientific and technological objectives of the project; - the main lines and timetable of the execution plan, highlighting the articulation of the various components; - the stages of implementation and the results expected in each one of them; - the role of the participants within the consortium and the specific skills of each of them; - the organisation and management of the project; - the plan for the dissemination of knowledge and the exploitation of results; - the global budget estimate and the budget for the different activities, including a financial plan identifying the various contributions and their origin. the partnership may evolve when necessary, within the limits of the initial community contribution, by replacing participants or adding new ones. in most cases, this will be done through publication of a competitive call . the implementation plan will be updated yearly. this updating may entail the reorientation of certain activities and the launching of new ones. in the latter case, and where an additional community contribution is needed, the commission will identify these activities and the participants who will carry them out, by means of a call for proposals. the community contribution shall take the form of a grant to the budget, calculated as a percentage of the budget allocated by the participants to carry out the project, adapted according to the type of activity. a.3 collective research projects for smes implemented across the whole field of science and technology, these projects will be carried out by research entities for the benefit of industrial associations or groupings, in areas and on subjects of interest to a large number of smes confronted with common problems. b other instruments in order to implement the programme, other instruments may also be used: b1 specific targeted research projects specific targeted research projects will aim at improving european competitiveness. they will be sharply focussed and will take either of the following two forms, or a combination of the two: (a) a research and technological development project designed to gain new knowledge either to improve considerably or to develop new products, processes or services or to meet other needs of society and community policies; (b) a demonstration project designed to prove the viability of new technologies offering potential economic advantage but which cannot be commercialised directly. b2 cooperative research projects for smes implemented across the whole field of science and technology, these projects will be undertaken for the benefit of a number of smes on themes of common interest. b3 coordination actions coordination actions are intended to promote and support the coordinated initiatives of a range of research and innovation operators aiming at improved integration. they will cover activities such as the organisation of conferences, meetings, the performance of studies, exchanges of personnel, the exchange and dissemination of good practices, setting up information systems and expert groups, and may, if necessary, include support for the definition, organisation and management of joint or common initiatives. b4 specific support actions specific support actions will complement the implementation of the framework programme and may be used to help in preparations for future community research and technological development policy activities including monitoring and assessment activities. in particular, they will involve conferences, seminars, studies and analyses, high level scientific awards and competitions, working groups and expert groups, operational support and dissemination, information and communication activities, or a combination of these, as appropriate in each case. legislative financial statement policy area(s): research activity(ies): research actions under the ec treaty title of action: proposal for a council decision adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at \u00abintegrating and strengthening the european research area\u00bb. 1. budget line(s) + heading(s) subsection b6 6 indirect actions: these lines will be specified at the beginning of the 2003 budget procedure, taking into account the abb nomenclature, which is being drawn up. 2. overall figures 2.1. total allocation for action (part b): eur12 855 million for commitments 2.2. period of application: 2002-2006 2.3. overall multiannual estimate of expenditure: a) schedule of commitment appropriations/payment appropriations (financial intervention) (see point 6.1.1 eur million (to 3rd decimal place) &gt;table position&gt;

4. legal basis article 166 of the ec treaty. proposal for a decision of the european parliament and of the council adopting the framework programme 2002-2006 of the european community for research, technological development and demonstration activities aimed at contributing towards the creation of the european research area. 5. description and grounds 5.1. need for community intervention 5.1.1 objectives pursued as recognised at the highest political level by the european council in lisbon, feira, nice and again recently in stockholm, research is a central component of the knowledge-based economy and society developing worldwide. the objective set for the eu in lisbon was \"to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\" over the next decade. more than ever, research is proving to be one of the main driving forces for economic and social progress, a key factor in business competitiveness, employment and the quality of life. in addition, science and technology are key elements in the policy-making process at both eu and national level. however, europe still has structural weaknesses where research is concerned. these can be summed up in four main points: i. insufficient and dispersed investment in research and technological development and more generally in knowledge (rtd, education and software), with the result that we are lagging behind our competitors. in 1999, the eu invested eur 76 billion less than the us in research and development. it is now lagging behind its competitors in terms of research spending as a proportion of gdp (in 1999, the figure was 1.9% for the eu compared with 2.6% for the us and 2.9% for japan [27]). in 1999, the us invested some 9% in knowledge, ahead of the eu (7.6%) and japan (6.9%). and the gap is continuing to widen. [27] 1998 figure. ii. insufficient human resources in research. researchers represent 5.3/1000 of the workforce in the eu (1998), 7.4/1000 in the us (1993) and 8.9/1000 in japan (1998) where there are twice as many researchers in industry. direct public spending on higher education corresponds to 0.9% of gdp in the eu, 1.4% in the us and 0.5% in japan (1997) iii. a limited capacity to translate scientific breakthroughs into innovative and competitive products and services, despite high-quality scientific production. the figures for the number of patents granted by the european, american and japanese patents offices per million inhabitants are 32 in the eu, 49 in the us and 88 in japan. in 1998, the trade balance for high-tech products was a eur28 billion deficit for the eu (a trend confirmed throughout the decade), compared with a eur8 billion deficits for the us and an eur 39 billion surplus for japan. risk capital investment in the advanced sectors corresponds to 80% in the us and, while it is on the increase, only 26 % in the eu and 23% in japan. iv. a fragmentation of research policies in europe. the eu has not yet adopted a fully-fledged research policy. the 15 national policies co-exist side by side and alongside the community framework programme without adequate coordination between them to achieve efficient organisation and exploitation. this lack of coordination also affects the establishment and efficient exploitation of research infrastructures. to alleviate this situation, the commission has proposed and council and parliament have endorsed the creation of a \"european research area\". bringing it about will necessarily be the product of a joint effort by the community, the member states and research stakeholders. the community research framework programmes (2002-2006) and the specific programmes will make a contribution to this in particular through the significant leverage effect that they can have for integrating, coordinating and structuring research in the eu and strengthening the foundations of the european research area. a structural change in the eu's s&t fabric to remedy the above mentioned weaknesses will need resources commensurate with the objective. the commission has proposed funding for the framework programme totalling eur 17.5 billion, corresponding to the previous level of funding plus inflation and growth (but still representing only 5 to 6% of public spending on rtd). the commission takes the view that this sort of amount could have a significant effect on the research system as such, improve at least some of the overall research indicators, and have a significant effect in the priority areas of the framework programme which will generate growth in the eu. in overall terms, this level of funding will make it possible to maintain the community's rtd effort expressed as percentage of gdp at its present level during the period 2003-2006. the plan is to implement the framework programmes by five specific programmes, three of which come under the european community treaty and two under the european atomic energy (euratom) treaty. each specific programme is identified according to the nature of the instruments deployed, reflecting the objectives and organisation of the framework programme: - a programme on \"integrating and strengthening the european research area\" comprising the indirect actions proposed under the heading \"focusing and integrating research\" and under the heading \"strengthening the foundations of the european research area\", thus bring together research and coordination activities. - a programme on \"structuring the european research area\", comprising horizontal, support and structuring activities. - two \"joint research centre (jrc)\" programmes comprising the direct actions carried out by the jrc in the non-nuclear and nuclear fields respectively. - a \"nuclear energy\" programme comprising the indirect actions carried out in the field of nuclear energy. there is a clear correspondence between the first two programmes and the four activities mentioned in article 164 of the ec treaty. the amounts deemed necessary for these two specific programmes reflect the correspondence in annex ii to the framework programme proposal, on the one hand the respective shares of the various activities, and on the other the indicative breakdown of the maximum overall amount between the blocks and categories of activities. the need for coherent utilisation of the three new instruments for the integration of research activities in europe together with specific targeted research projects and co-ordination actions, makes it necessary to implement the actions proposed in the various priority thematic areas by means of a single specific programme. similarly, carrying out a substantial proportion of the international cooperation activities in the form of opening up networks and projects to participation of third country researchers and organisations makes it necessary to integrate activities in this area and the research activities in a single programme. lastly, the particular character of jrc activities, as well as the need to ensure that it has sufficient budgetary autonomy, justify a separate specific programme in the ec field and in the euratom field. the objectives of the specific programme on \"integrating and strengthening the european research area\" are set out below by action areas, together with their justification and the european added value that they can provide. 1. focusing and integrating community research 1.1. priority thematic areas of research 1.1.1. genomics and biotechnologies for health the actions carried out in this area are intended to help europe to exploit, by means of an integrated research effort, the results of breakthroughs achieved in decoding the genomes of living organisms, more particularly for the benefit of public health and citizens and to increase the competitiveness of the european biotechnology industry. the emphasis will be put on research aimed at bringing basic knowledge through to application, to enable real and consistent progress in medicine and improve quality of life. justification and european added value - need to develop the knowledge base, tools and resources necessary for exploiting the full potential of genome information that underpins applications, by integration of the research capacities across europe to increase coherence and achieve critical mass. - major breakthroughs are expected in the creation of new products, processes, services as regards health care and medicine in the field of postgenomics research - there is a global emergency caused by the 3 major communicable diseases (hiv/aids, malaria, and tuberculosis) that make up 60 % of the total disease burden in developing countries. - need to develop synergies between existing national activities to combat cancer in order to achieve critical mass and create added value. 1.1.2. information society technologies (ist) the actions carried out in this area, in line with the conclusions of the european council in lisbon and the objectives of the e-europe initiative, are intended to stimulate the development in europe of technologies and applications at the centre of the construction of the information society in order to increase the competitiveness of european industry and allow people the possibility of benefiting fully from the development of the knowledge-based society. concentration on the future ist generation will bring ist applications and services to everyone and enable the development of more user-centred information technologies. justification and european added value - requirement for the development of europe's knowledge-based economy and society as agreed at the lisbon council. europe has to increase its research effort in ist: half of rtd in ist in oecd countries is concentrated in the us, 25% in japan and only 15% in europe. - public sector has a critical role in supporting high-risk and/or long term research in ist and in bringing together key actors in the field from industry and academia so as to further develop key technologies and their applications, to explore ground-breaking ideas and to improve efficiency and impact of research investment. - community effort in rtd in ist provides a unique opportunity to aggregate the fragmented research effort of the member states and to build solutions which are interoperable and implementable across the member states. - experience shows that only a sustained and appropriate research effort in ist can have the desired impact. in europe, the effort of countries like finland is a direct illustration of the benefit of rtd investment in ist. ist has been a research priority for more than 30 years and the relevant rtd investment is the highest as a percentage of gdp worldwide. - the ist sector now has an annual turnover of eur 2000 billion worldwide and employs more than 12 m. persons in europe. europe's role as an ist supplier is to be strengthened. the trade deficit of the eu in ist is of about 28 beuro for an eu market of about 500 beuro and the deficit is growing by 12 % a year despite europe's lead in mobile communications. - ist has become a motor for overall economic growth as a result both of its own expansion and its increasing integration in other sectors. research in applied ist in businesses, for e-commerce and e-work, opens new market opportunities and provides substantial productivity gains and improves competitiveness of all industries. the life cycles of ist based products and services are quickening and shortening and technology adoption curves are faster, underlining the acceleration of technology change. - the emerging generation of ist will introduce a radical shift from the current 'pc-based' systems and the 'keyboard, mouse and screen' towards ambient intelligence systems which will enable all citizens to benefit from ist services. - ist innovations provide powerful solutions to major societal challenges in healthcare, environment, learning, safety, mobility, and preservation of cultural heritage and employment. - progress is needed in ist for the development of all other major research fields including biotechnologies, physics, energy, etc. 1.1.3. nanotechnologies and nanosciences, knowledge-based multifunctional materials, and new production processes and devices the actions carried out in this area are intended to help achieve the critical mass of capacities needed to develop and exploit, in particular for eco-efficiency and reduction of discharges of hazardous substances into the environment, leading edge technologies for the knowledge and intelligence-based products, services and manufacturing processes over the years to come. justification and european added value - need to maintain a strong position for europe in these emerging markets - medium-term market for nanomaterials estimated at over eur6 billion (medical equipment sector) and intelligent materials market estimated at several hundreds of billions of euros. - impact of knowledge-based multifunctional materials on the development of industrial technologies and systems and indirectly on sectors such as energy, medicine, electronics, transport or construction. - importance of the manufacturing sector in europe: 40 million jobs and eur4,000 billion. - investments to be stepped up in the field of new production processes (at present some eur1000 per capita compared with eur 2000 per capita in the us). 1.1.4. aeronautics and space the aim of the actions carried out in this area is twofold: to consolidate, by integrating its research efforts, the position of the european aeronautics and space industry vis-\u00e0-vis increasingly strong world competition; and to help exploit the potential of this sector with a view to improving safety and environmental protection. justification and european added value - scale of investments needed (us investment in rtd three to six times higher depending on the sectors). - foreseeable needs concerning air transport on a world scale: some 14,000 aircraft in the next 15 years (market worth eur1000 billion). increase in air traffic of around 5% per annum for the next few decades or a doubling in the next 20 years. - importance of the satellite related markets (world annual turnover for satellites and launchers estimated at eur40 billion). - support for the \"single european sky\" policy. 1.1.5. food quality and safetythe actions carried out in this area are intended to help establish the integrated scientific and technological bases needed to develop an environmentally friendly system of production and distribution of safe and healthy food, in line with consumer requirements, and control of food-related risks, relying in particular on biotechnology tools, as well as health risks associated with environmental changes. justification and european added value - recent food scares have highlighted the multi-factorial and trans-border nature of the issues at stake - the development of powerful and validated risk assessment methods requires the pooling of a wide range of expertise - the agri-food industry is a very large job provider in europe with more than 10 million employees - environmental factors contributing significantly to increasing incidence of cancer, allergy, asthma - increased consumer demand regarding traceability of food products 1.1.6. sustainable development, global change and ecosystems the activities carried out in this area are intended to strengthen the scientific and technological capacities needed for europe to be able to implement sustainable development, recognized as a community objective by the g\u00f6teborg european council, integrating its environmental, economic and social dimensions, with particular regard to secure sustainable energy and transport. these activities should make a significant contribution to the international effort to understand and control global change and preserve the equilibrium of ecosystems. 1.1.6.1. sustainable energy systems justification and european added value - uncertainties, interruptions of, or reductions in, energy supply, and even instability of energy prices, may have a severe negative impact on society and the economy. - the probability of major climate change is strongly enhanced by the high and increasing level of co2 emissions related to energy supply and use - the eu's dependence on energy imports is already 50% and expected to rise over the coming years (if no action is taken), reaching 70% by 2020 - renewable energy technologies typically have relatively higher costs than established fossil fuel based technologies 1.1.6.2 sustainable surface transport justification and european added value - 97% of freight and 95% of passengers use surface transport in europe contributing on one side to the economic prosperity of europe but at the same time: - affecting the environment by producing noxious emissions, spillage of toxic products, creating noise nuisance and being responsible for 24% of co2 emissions - causing 40 000 fatal accidents and several hundred thousand serious injuries - around 10 million people are directly employed by the surface transport sector - surface transport-related congestion (costing about 0.5% of eu gnp), safety and environmental issues have a strong impact on sustainable development requiring actions at european level with a co-ordinated and integrated approach. 1.1.6.3 global change and ecosystems justification and european added value - requirement for the faster development of europe's capacity to predict, control and adapt to global change in order to maintain and improve the eu citizens' quality of life and contribute to the international conventions (kyoto and montreal protocols), as well as for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity. - the sustainable development concept needs to be integrated in the eu policies, in particular energy, transport, environment and enterprise. - the estimated downward trend in ozone over europe is of 7 % per decade and followed by an increasing trend of uv radiation. - climate change has an impact on natural resources in particular on water availability and quality, and on biodiversity and ecosystems. - there will be an increased warming in the future with different not yet known impacts on europe and its regions. - strategies for the sustainable use of land and marine resources, including agricultural and forest resources, are needed for the sustainable development of europe especially considering global change issues. - the annual budget for this research area is estimated at eur 2 billion world-wide and eur 500 m at european level (fp 20% of the total eu contribution). 1.1.7. citizens and governance in a knowledge-based society the actions carried out in this area are intended to mobilise in a coherent effort, in all their wealth and diversity, research capacities in economic, political, social and human sciences that are necessary to develop an understanding of and to address issues related to the emergence of the knowledge-based society and new forms of relationships between people on one hand and people and institutions on the other. justification and european added value - the need to understand the issues and options involved in the objective for the european union \"to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion\", by building a european knowledge society - the need to understand and have an informed discussion on the issues and options involved in the development and evolution of new forms of governance in an enlarging europe and its implications for european citizens; 1.2. specific activities covering a wider field of research 1.2.1. supporting policies and anticipating scientific and technological needs the aim is to develop research activities in support of other community policies, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to be able to launch research activities rapidly as unforeseeable scientific and technological needs appear. justification and european added value - need to develop research activities in support of other community policies. this need has been confirmed by all the commission services which implement community policies. - need to be able launch rapidly research activities as unforeseeable scientific and technological needs appear. the rapid emergence of unforeseen needs such as, in the past, those connected with bse, for example, have demonstrated the importance of this. 1.2.2. horizontal research activities involving smes carried out in support of european competitiveness and enterprise and innovation policy, the specific activities for smes are intended to help european smes in traditional or new areas to boost their technological capacities and develop their ability to operate on a european and international scale. justification and european added value - smes account for 99.8% of european businesses, 66% of jobs and 55% of the eu's private sector turnover. - it is estimated that smes contribute nearly 50% to the competitiveness of bigger businesses as suppliers or subcontractors. - high-tech smes are making a growing contribution to research in sectors such as it, multimedia and biotechnology. - the framework programme for research and technological development (rdt) is an important instrument: over the last 5 years (1994-1999), over 20 000 european smes benefited from this opportunity and, according to a satisfaction survey, nearly 96% of them are satisfied with their choice. 1.2.3. specific measures in support of international cooperation the general objective of the international cooperation activities carried out under the framework programme is to help open up the european research area to the world. specific activities will concern three groups of countries: the mediterranean and balkan third countries, russia and the states of the cis, and the developing countries. justification and european added value - certain global issues (climate change, biodiversity, etc.) can only be addressed in partnership with third countries. - europe envisages privileged relations with certain groups of countries (nis, mediterranean countries, etc.). scientific partnerships with those countries will facilitate the establishment and strengthening of these relations. - certain countries (developing countries, for example) are faced with specific problems necessitating coordinated action. - the expertise and knowledge existing in the world is of interest to european researchers which should have access to them. 2. strengthening the foundations of the european research area 2.1. support for the coordination of activities the objective is to encourage and support initiatives undertaken by several countries, in areas of common strategic interest (such as health, biotechnology, environment, energy) and to develop synergy between their existing activities through coordination of their implementation. it is also to enhance the complementarity and synergy between community actions undertaken under the framework programme and those of other european scientific co-operation organisations as well as among these organisations themselves. justification and european added value - avoid duplication and fragmentation of effort - reduce gaps between the most advanced and less advanced regions. - exploit the efforts already made with a view to collaboration between member states. 2.2. support for the coherent development of policies the objective of the activities carried out in this area is to promote the coherent development of research and innovation policies in europe through the early identification of challenges and areas of common interest as well as by supplying national and community policy makers with knowledge and decision-aid tools that can help them formulate these policies. justification and european added value - need to use more systematically foresight results, in order to strengthen the ability to anticipate s&t-related issues at stake for europe, to develop shared views on such issues, and more generally to create a strategic basis for european s&t policy - necessity to respond to the reinforced demand from s&t policy makers for a common base of relevant and comparable indicators - need for a strategic tool to improve the quality and efficiency of research policies: benchmarking national policies - respond to the need for research players and users to be able to locate specific expertise easily in the context of their activities. 5.1.2 measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation an ex-ante evaluation was carried out by the commission services when preparing the specific programme proposals. its results reflect in particular: - the recommendations of the five-year assessment of the framework programmes and specific programmes carried out by independent experts in the course of the year 2000; - the commission's mid-term review of the fifth framework programme (1998-2002) presented in com(2000)612 of 4 october 2000 and detailed in commission staff paper sec(2000)1780 of 23 october 2000; - wide-ranging consultations among the protagonists relating to the two communications on the european research area in the course of the year 2000 [28] and the framework programme proposal at the beginning of 2001; [28] com (2000) 6 of 18 january 2000 com (2000) 612 of 4 october 2000 - a series of internal and external commission studies relating to economic, political and foresight areas and the impact of rtd activities. the results of the ex-ante evaluation carried out are reflected in particular in the choices made with regard to the structure of the programmes, the objectives and priorities and the implementing instruments. the objectives and priorities were selected in accordance with the rigorous application of the criterion of european added value. this covers the following aspects applied to the priority themes and activities selected, the justification and european added value of which are described in greater detail in point 5.1. and the expected results in point 5.2. - cost and scale of research beyond the possibilities of a single country, and need to assemble a critical mass of financial and human resources (e.g. genomics, nanotechnologies, aeronautics); - economic interest of collaboration (economies of scale) and as a result of its beneficial effects on the private research effort and industrial competitiveness (e.g. information society technologies, nanotechnologies, intelligent materials, new production processes, aeronautics and space and specific research activities for smes); - maintenance or development of the eu's position in rtd areas strategic for the eu (e.g. maintaining the strong position in aeronautics and mobile phones and developing the, at present, relatively low potential in solar photovoltaic energy) ; - need to combine complementary expertise present in different countries, more particularly to deal with interdisciplinary problems (e.g. food safety and health risks, sustainable development and global change, support for the coordination of research and innovation activities and coherent development of research policies); - links with the priorities and interests of the eu as well as with community legislation and policies (e.g. aeronautics and space, food safety and health risks, sustainable development and global change, citizens and governance in the european knowledge-based society, international cooperation, anticipating the eu's s&t needs); - necessarily transnational nature of the research by virtue of the scale at which problems occur or for scientific reasons (e.g. food safety and health risks, sustainable development and global change, citizens and governance in the european knowledge-based society, international cooperation, support for the coordination of research and innovation activities; coherent development of research policies); with regard to the implementing instruments, further to the specific targeted research projects and the co-ordination actions, three main new instruments, which by their nature can only be implemented at community level, have been designed as an overall priority to contribute to the establishment of: - a critical mass needed and the integration of research - closer links between the programmes and member states' activities and coordination of national programmes - cooperation in areas strategic for the eu and solutions to major challenges facing the eu - the excellence and attractiveness of s&t in europe - dissemination and exploitation of s&t results throughout the eu. to ensure the impact of community efforts in the seven priority thematic areas of the framework programmeemployed in these areas, networks of excellence and integrated projects will be used from the start of the sixth framework programme in each theme and, where deemed appropriate, as a priority means, while maintaining the use of specific targeted projects and coordination actions. the instruments are: a) networks of excellence the purpose of this instrument is to strengthen and develop european scientific and technological excellence by means of the integration, at european level, of research capacities existing or emerging at both national and regional level. each network will also aim at advancing knowledge in a particular area by assembling a critical mass of expertise. generally targeted towards long-term objectives, the activities concerned, often multidisciplinary, are not aimed at precise predefined results in terms of products, processes or services. a network of excellence will be implemented by a joint programme of activities involving some, or, where appropriate, all of the research capacities and activities of the participants in the relevant area to attain a critical mass of expertise and european added value. a joint programme of activities could aim at the creation of a self-standing virtual centre of excellence that may result in developing the necessary means for achieving a durable integration of the research capacities. b) integrated projects integrated projects are designed to give increased impetus to the community's competitiveness or to address major societal needs by mobilising a critical mass of research and technological development resources and competences. each integrated project should be assigned clearly defined scientific and technological objectives and should be directed at obtaining specific results applicable in terms of, for instance, products, processes or services. under these objectives they may include more long-term or \"risky\" research. all the activities carried out in the context of an integrated project will fit into the general framework of an \"implementation plan\". c) participation in national programmes carried out jointly (under article 169 of the treaty) the objective of this instrument is to promote and support the coherent and coordinated mobilisation for the benefit of the entire eu of the organised efforts (programmes) of the member states in areas of common and priority interest to the union. the aim is also to increase the impact of national efforts on an eu scale in matters of interest to many member states. the national programmes in the priority research areas of the framework programme in question will be those carried out either by governments, regional authorities or national research organisations. their joint implementation will entail the drawing up of harmonised work programmes, the coordination of the assignment of budgets; a redirection of certain actions to increase complementarity, and the launching of joint calls for proposals. this instrument has never been used before as it presupposes a desire for mutual coordination between member states and will require a more substantial preparation phase compared with more conventional projects. nevertheless, the time is judged to be right - in particular following the lisbon summit and the call for the open coordination method - for this type of instrument. 5.1.3 measures taken following ex post evaluation the recommendations of the five-year assessment of the framework programmes and the specific programmes carried out in 2000 have been taken into account in preparing the specific programme proposals, in particular those concerning: - the need to make up for europe's trailing position in the field of rtd compared with its competitors; - the need for complementarity and coherence between national and community rtd policies and the essential role of the commission in achieving this objective; - the beneficial impact of the framework programme which \"fills a gap in europe by enabling researchers in universities and in industry to carry out applied work together\"; - the need to lighten the procedures of the 1998-2002 programme and the need to \"rethink the structures and procedures for managing the framework programme\"; - placing community research activities in the broader context of a genuine european research policy; - reinforcing the concentration of the programmes; - continuing with the research needed to achieve the objectives of community policies; - the desired move towards an adapted range of instruments that are more flexible, taking account of all the possibilities offered by the treaty. in addition, the mid-term review of the fifth framework programme has resulted in particular in adjustments to the annual work programmes for the specific programmes, aimed at concentrating efforts to a greater extent and launching pilot projects for the measures envisaged for the next framework programme (networks, clusters, industrial platforms, larger-scale projects, etc.). 5.2. actions envisaged and means of budget intervention the actions envisaged for the specific programme on \"integrating and strengthening the european research area\" are set out below presented by detailed action areas. this presentation makes it possible to highlight the estimated results expected, the contributions to the overall objectives of the framework programme or of the community or

being strictly proportional to that for the entire specific programme, itself in line with that of the framework programme. the annual internal breakdown will be established subsequently within the work programmes 6.1.2 technical and administrative assistance, support expenditure and it expenditure (commitment appropriations) this budget category does not apply in this field. 6.2. calculation of costs by measure envisaged in part b (over the entire programming period) for the indirect actions of the fifth framework programme of the european community (1998-2002), the annual volume is in the order of 3500 new contracts signed (all categories confound), for an annual budget of eur 3000 million. for the indirect actions of the framework programme 2002-2006, the annual budget will be in the order of eur 3700 million, an increase in real terms by 13 %. nevertheless, as set out in point 5.1.2, three new principal instruments have been designed for the implementation of this new framework programme, namely networks of excellence, integrated projects and participation to joint execution of national programmes (as provided for in article 169 of the treaty) that will apply within the thematic priority areas further to the specific targeted research projects and the co-ordination actions. compared to previous framework programmes, the new instruments go beyond merely scientific projects and introduce the concept of integration of research, in particular by achiving critical mass of competences and resources in identified areas. 7. impact on staff and administrative expenditure currently in the parts of the 5th framework programme related to indirect, non-nuclear research, the overall ceiling for human resources and other administrative expenditure is 7.0%. assuming there were to be no change in the methods of implementing the framework programme, and given the need to allow for some margin in this category of expenditure, the commission would have no reason to depart from this overall ceiling of 7%. given that the budget for the sixth framework programme is 17% higher than the fifth framework programme, this would have implied a net increase of around 250 permanent posts on top of the 1654 posts allowed in 2002. the commission is however committed to achieving significant gains in productivity in the implementation of the sixth framework programme. this commitment will lead to an important reduction of the share linked to personnel and administration costs in relation to the previous framework programme. in the initial commission proposal, this would have allowed administrative and personnel costs to be reduced to 5.5% of the programme budget, and statutory posts to be frozen at the 2002 levels. the main factor that would allow this to be achieved is the productivity gains arising from the introduction of the new instruments proposed in the next framework programme, namely integrated projects, networks of excellence and joint execution of national research programmes under article 169 of the treaty. in the commission's original proposal, these instruments would have been used exclusively in the implementation of the thematic priorities, which constitute the largest part of the framework programme. however, as a result of the council common position on the framework programme, taking into account the amendments of the european parliament, the use of the new instruments will not be exclusive. , in consequence, the instruments of the fifth framework programme will continue to be used alongside the new instruments to a greater extent than originally envisaged. these instruments generally involve small-scale contracts to be concluded directly with the commission. the direct consequence of this decision is a much larger number of contracts to be managed by the commission compared to the initial proposal. the exact number of additional projects to be managed cannot be known; on reasonable scenarios, it could be of the order of 25% to 33% higher than the original number envisaged. this substantial expected increase in the number of contracts to be managed represents effectively additional tasks for the commission. in line with the commission decision following the peer group exercise not to accept additional tasks if the corresponding resources are not available, an increase in the administrative and personnel resources of the framework programme is therefore required. in order to identify the potential sources for such additional resources, the commission has examined various options: - redeployment of human resources: as part of the peer group exercise, a detailed activity-by-activity review was carried out of the management of the framework programme. significant economies were identified in the indirect non-nuclear research area (98 posts in dg research representing around 10 % of statutory personnel). these economies have now been achieved through redeployment and other measures. there appears to be no scope for further redeployment in the short to medium term. - restructuring of the \"tableau des effectifs\" by converting c to a and b staff: the scope for this option was examined, however it cannot effectively be used, due to the fact that support staff in the research sector accounts for 26% of the total, which is well below the commission average of 32%. any further reduction in this percentage would cause difficulties in the management of research contracts. - vacancy rate: although the current vacancy rate of 8% is higher than the commission average of 4%, it is accounted for by the circumstances applying to one specific category of staff, i.e. support staff in category c. it reflects historical structural difficulties in recruiting such staff to the research sector, where the possibilities have up to now been strictly limited. these difficulties are addressed in the commission's communication of 27 december 2001 for the reform of research personnel policy and are expected to diminish in the medium-term bringing the average vacancy rate in the research sector down to the overall average of the commission. - externalisation: the commission initial proposal was based largely on the exclusive use of the new instruments, whose implementation implies the externalisation of a number of management tasks to the organisations actually participating in the projects. the common position of the council on the sixth framework programme reintroduces into the programme the old instruments, effectively requiring the commission to \"internalise\" again some of these tasks. in addition to the externalisation implied by the use of the new instruments, the commission is examining further externalisation of specific parts of the programme, but this assumption was already built into the initial proposal for 5.5% of administrative costs. this matter will be reviewed after the council regulation laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of community programmes [30] comes into effect. [30] (com(2000) 788 - c5-0036/2001 - 2000/0337(cns)) the commission has also examined the scope for further increases in productivity. although the total number of contracts will increase significantly as compared with the original proposal, the commission believes that, with increases in productivity and efficiency, the increase in staff resources required to manage these projects can be kept less than proportional to the increase in the workload. in conclusion, the initial 5.5% of administrative and personnel expenses needs to be increased to cover the additional tasks which the commission has to carry out as a result of the common position. this increase will primarily cover 50 additional statutory posts (28a, 15 b, 7c) of a temporary nature. reflecting additional productivity gains, this increase represents some 3% of total statutory staff. it will also provide for an additional important investment in the development of an adequate it system - as recommended by a recent report of the court of auditors.. the 50 additional temporary posts are those covered by article 2a of the raa and will therefore not increase the current total number of permanent posts in the commission. it would be possible to provide for this additional expenditure within an overall ceiling of 6.0% of the budget. the commission therefore proposes to lower the overall ceiling for human resources and other administrative expenditure for the two indirect, non-nuclear programmes from 7.0% in the 5th framework programme to 6.0% in the sixth framework-programme. this ceiling of 6.0% still expresses the commission's determination to rethink and improve the implementation of the framework programme, within the constraints of the common position. it is conditional on being able to achieve the degree of simplification in management proposed in the rules of participation proposed by the commission in september 2001. the commission has the intention of reviewing this ceiling of 6% for 2006, and making recommendations, before proposing the next framework programme, in the light of the experience in implementing the 6th framework programme and of the use of the new instruments. this review will examine the scope for additional gains in efficiency in the management of the programme, including the possibility for further reductions in administrative costs. the proposed ceiling for administrative and personnel costs requires also efficient programme and budget structures, and this reduced 6.0 % ceiling should apply for the total of the two indirect, non-nuclear research programmes. it requires equitable efforts in productivity gains in all research activities. in implementing these programmes, the commission will ensure an appropriate share of administrative expenditure between the services responsible for managing research activities. this share will take account of the overall budget to be managed, the intensity of the use of the three new instruments, the labour-intensiveness and the latest technological developments of the activities at the various stages of their life-cycle, including their length, and the need to ensure effective management of the contracts committed under previous framework programmes. 7.1. impact on human resources &gt;table position&gt; there is a specific establishment plan in 2001 for the indirect research actions comprising a total of 954 a posts, 273 b posts and 427 c posts, giving a total of 1654 posts (ec and euratom, including sab 3/2001). to this establishment plan should be added 156 operating budget posts with no financial impact on the budget for these programmes, under the heading of participation in the formulation and implementation of research policy. the estimated reinforcement of 50 posts is now to be added to these figures giving a total of 1704 posts (ec and euratom), of which 50 are temporary, and 156 operating budget posts (see point 7). 7.2 overall financial impact of human resource &gt;table position&gt; the amounts correspond to total expenditure for the duration of the programme. 7.3 other administrative expenditure deriving from the action &gt;table position&gt; the amounts correspond to total expenditure for the action for the four years of implementation of this specific programme, i.e. total annual expenditure of eur193.000 million. i. total (7.2 + 7.3) (eurmillion) ii. duration of action (years) iii. indicative annual cost (eurmillion) // 771.300 193.000 8. follow-up and evaluation 8.1 follow-up arrangements the specific programmes are designed to help bring about the european research area and they will be implemented in parallel with and in close collaboration with other community and national activities in pursuit of the same objectives. the very nature of research and the different types of actions at different levels make it difficult to determine causes and effects, and monitoring and evaluating the result and impact are complex. based on the experience of the earlier programmes and methodological studies in progress, a series of instruments has already been or is being finalised in order to develop the objectives and monitor and evaluate the results and impact of the framework programme and programmes implementing it, as well as the activities relating to bringing about the era. the commission will take stock of the development of these instruments in good time before the programmes are implemented. by these means, a structured system for collection of information and statistics will be progressively put in place. within this context general indicators specifically adapted to the framework programme will be developed, to make it possible to evaluate in particular the contributions of the programmes in relation to the challenges facing the eu identified in point 5.1 (investment in rtd and in knowledge, overall and in the priority fields for the eu, human rtd resources, exploitation of rtd results, coherence of national and community research policies and with regard to research infrastructures). in addition, more specific indicators will be identified for the different objectives of the programmes; relating in particular to the production, management and networking, exploitation and impact of the knowledge arising from the activities carried out under the programmes. first thoughts in this connection are already indicated in point 5.2 under the heading of results expected, contributions to overall objectives or potential performance parameters. 8.2 arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation - annual monitoring: the commission will, where appropriate by calling upon suitable expertise, continuously monitor the implementation of the framework programme and the specific programmes in the light of the objectives set. it will assess, in particular, whether the objectives, priorities, instruments, financial resources and management are still appropriate to the changing situation. the objective is to step up and improve the systematic collection, coherence and quality of the basic information, in order to allow efficient analysis and monitoring as well as a substantial contribution to the five-year assessment. in order to make community research managers more aware of issues relating to the monitoring of the implementation and the results and the impact of the programmes, it is also planned to draw up a joint self-assessment format. in addition, measures will be taken to ensure greater coherence between the monitoring of the framework programme, the specific programmes and progress with the european research area. - annual report: progress with implementing the framework programme and the specific programmes will be published in the annual report submitted to the european parliament and the council pursuant to article 173 of the treaty. it will set out in particular the results of the annual monitoring, a description of the activities carried out in the field of research and technological development, realisation of the european research area and dissemination of results during the preceding year, and the work programme for the current year. in 2004 an evaluation will be undertaken by independent experts of the efficiency of each of the three types of instruments implementing the priority thematic areas (networks of excellence, integrated projects, and the stairways of excellence-specific targeted research projects and co-ordination actions-). - five-year assessment: before submitting its proposal for the next framework programme and the specific programmes, the commission will have an assessment carried out by independent high-level experts of the implementation of community activities during the five years preceding that assessment, the achievement of the objectives and the impact of the activities in the light of the objectives applicable to the periods in question. the commission will communicate the conclusions of this assessment, accompanied by its observations, to the european parliament, the council, the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions. 9. anti-fraud measures by submitting reports which may give rise to the consolidation of revenue in the participants' accounts, the financial coordinator should make all the financial documentation available to the commission to enable it to carry out its financial audits, indicating the timetable and the consolidation of the participants' accounts. where appropriate, the commission will carry out such financial audits, in particular if it has reasons to doubt the realistic nature of the account vis-\u00e0-vis the progress of work described in the activity reports. the community's financial audits will be carried out either by its own staff or by accounting experts approved according to the law of the participant audited. the community will chose the latter freely, while avoiding any risks of conflicts of interest which might be indicated to it by the participant subject to the audit. in addition, the commission will make sure in carrying out the research activities, that the financial interests of the european communities are protected by effective checks and, in case of detected irregularities, measures as well as deterrent and proportionate sanctions. in order to achieve this aim, rules on checks, measures and sanctions, with references to the regulations no 2988/95,02185/96, 1073/99 and 1074/99 will be taken up in all legal instruments used in the implementation of the programmes, including the specific contracts and the model contracts. in particular, the following points will have to be provided for in the contracts : - the introduction of specific contractual clauses to protect the financial interests of the ec in carrying out checks and controls in relation to the awards ; - the participation of administrative checks in the field of fraud-fighting, in accordance with regulations no 2185/96, 1073/99 and 1074/99 ; - the application of administrative sanctions for all intentional or negligent irregularities in the implementation of the contracts, in accordance with the framework regulation no 2988/95, including a black listing mechanism ; - the fact that possible recovery orders in case of irregularities and fraud be enforceable according to article 256 of the ec treaty. top", "direct_url": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1547243824524&uri=OJ:JOC_2002_181_E_0001_01", "word_counts": {"ddos": 0, "internet": 3, "cybercrime": 0, "protection": 18, "digital age": 0, "internet of things": 0, "data protection": 0, "cybersecurity": 0, "information security": 0, "cyber attack": 0, "cyber security": 0, "digital technologies": 0, "personal data": 1, "big data": 0, "egovernment": 0, "hacker": 0, "digital": 7, "cloud": 0, "privacy": 3, "cyber": 1, "digitalisation": 0, "surveillance systems": 1, "ict": 24, "security": 20}}
