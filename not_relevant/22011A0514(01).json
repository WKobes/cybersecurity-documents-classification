agreement, that a technical regulation may include or deal exclusively with marking or labelling requirements, and agree that where their technical regulations contain mandatory marking or labelling, they will observe the principles of article 2.2 of the tbt agreement, that technical regulations should not be prepared with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade, and should not be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective. 2. in particular, the parties agree that where a party requires mandatory marking or labelling of products: (a) the party shall endeavour to minimise its requirements for marking or labelling other than marking or labelling relevant to consumers or users of the product. where

objective; (b) the party may specify the form of labels or markings, but shall not require any prior approval, registration or certification in this regard. this provision is without prejudice to the right of the party to require prior approval of the specific information to be provided on the label or marking in the light of the relevant domestic regulation; (c) where the party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic operators, the party shall issue such number to the economic operators of the other party without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis; (d) the

be used. the simultaneous use of other languages shall not be prohibited, provided that, either the information provided in the other languages shall be identical to that provided in the specified language, or that the information provided in the additional language shall not constitute a deceptive statement regarding the product; and (e) the party shall, in cases where it considers that legitimate objectives under the tbt agreement are not compromised thereby, endeavour to accept non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically attached to the product. article 4.10 coordination mechanism 1. the parties agree to nominate tbt coordinators and to give appropriate information to the other party when their tbt

[5] central administration means the head office where ultimate decision-making takes place. [6] in line with its notification of the treaty establishing the european community to the wto (wt/reg39/1), the eu party understands the concept of \"effective and continuous link\" with the economy of a member state of the european union enshrined in article 48 of the treaty as equivalent to the concept of \"substantive business operations\" provided for in paragraph 6 of article v of the gats. accordingly, for a juridical person set up in accordance with the laws of korea and having only its registered office or central administration in the territory of korea, the eu party shall only extend the benefits of this agreement if that juridical person possesses an effective and continuous link with the economy of korea.

[40] it is understood that the term \"prudential reasons\" may include the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of individual financial service suppliers. [41] for greater certainty, this commitment indicates the rights and freedoms set out in the universal declaration of human rights, the guidelines for the regulation of computerised personal data files (adopted by the united general assembly resolution 45/95 of 14 december 1990), and the oecd guidelines on the protection of privacy and transborder flows of personal data (adopted by the oecd council on 23 september 1980).

(b) establishing competitive market conditions based on principles of openness, non-discrimination, proportionality and transparency; (c) gradually aligning their domestic regulations with existing international standards; (d) promoting \"one test\" and, where practicable, a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity through elimination of duplicative and unnecessarily burdensome conformity assessment procedures; (e) implementing appropriate regulatory and legal enforcement mechanisms related to product liability and market surveillance; and (f) enhancing cooperation to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade, as well as to improve product quality with a view to ensuring protection of public health and safety of products. 2. this annex shall apply to any standard, technical regulation and conformity assessment procedure that either party may introduce or maintain with respect to the safety and electromagnetic compatibility (hereinafter referred to as \"emc\") of electrical and electronic equipment, professional electrotechnical equipment, electrical household appliances and consumer electronics defined in appendix 2-b-1 (hereinafter referred to as \"covered products\"). article 2 international standards and standard-setting bodies 1. the parties recognise that the international organisation for standards (hereinafter referred to as the \"iso\"), the international electrotechnical commission (hereinafter referred to as the \"iec\") and the international telecommunication union (hereinafter referred to as the \"itu\") are the relevant international standard-setting bodies for emc and safety of covered products [1]. 2. where relevant international standards established by the iso, iec and itu exist, the parties shall use these international standards or the relevant parts of them as a basis for any standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure [2]. 3. the parties shall ensure that their standard-setting bodies participate in the development of international standards in the iso, iec and itu, and commit to consult with a view to establishing common approaches. article 3 conformity assessment procedure in case a party requires a positive assurance of conformity with technical regulations on emc or safety of covered products, the following rules shall apply [3]: (a) conformity assessment procedures shall not be prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade with the other party; (b) except as otherwise provided under this annex, including the transitional arrangements set out in article 4, each party shall accept products on its market [4] on the basis of one or more of the following procedures as positive assurance of conformity to its technical regulations on emc or safety of covered products: (i) a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity without requiring the intervention of any conformity assessment body or testing of the product by recognised testing laboratories; (ii) a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity based on a test report from any testing laboratory in the other party\u2019s territory that has been notified by the party at the entry into force of this agreement or in any subsequent notifications. the notifying party shall be solely responsible for notifying any laboratory which is competent [5] to perform the relevant tests in its territory, without prior approval or verification by the importing party. the importing party may require that the declaration of conformity is submitted by the supplier before the product is placed on its market and that the declaration contains the name of the testing laboratory issuing the test report and the issuing date of the test report. the importing party may also require a copy of the test report, including a list of critical components, demonstrating conformity to the requirements applicable to the product, and a general description of the product; or (iii) a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity based on a test report issued by: (a) any testing laboratory in the other party that has concluded voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by the importing party; or (b) a cb test laboratory of the other party under the iecee cb scheme, accompanied by a valid cb test certificate, in accordance with the rules and procedures of the iecee cb scheme and the commitments by the parties thereunder. the importing party may require for review before the product is placed on its market the submission of the declaration of conformity which contains a copy of the test report, including a list of critical components, demonstrating conformity to the requirements applicable to the product, and a general description of the product. the choice among the procedures in this subparagraph shall rest with each party subject to the limitations set out in appendix 2-b-2; (c) the parties shall accept the supplier as solely responsible for issuing, changing or withdrawing the declaration of conformity. the parties may require that the declaration of conformity is dated and identifies the supplier or the supplier\u2019s authorised representative in their territories, the person empowered by the manufacturer or his authorised representative to sign the declaration, the products covered by the declaration, and the applied technical regulations to which conformity is declared. when a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity is for a batch of products, it shall cover each article of the batch. when testing is undertaken, the choice of the testing laboratory shall rest with the supplier; and (d) beyond what is set out in this article, a party shall not require any form of registration of products that may prevent or otherwise delay the placing on the market of products that comply with the party\u2019s technical regulations. in so far as a party reviews the supplier\u2019s declaration in line with subparagraph (b)(iii), the review shall be solely limited to verifying, on the basis of the documentation submitted, that the test has been done in accordance with the party\u2019s relevant technical regulations and that the information contained in the documentation is complete. any such review shall not cause undue delay for the placing of the products on the party\u2019s market and the declaration shall be accepted, without exceptions, if the products comply with the party\u2019s technical regulations and the documentation submitted is complete. in the event that a declaration is rejected, the party shall communicate its decision to the supplier immediately, together with a detailed explanation of the grounds for the rejection and how these can be rectified by the supplier, as well as an explanation of possibilities to appeal the decision. article 4 transitional arrangements 1. the european union shall comply with article 3(b) of this annex upon the entry into force of this agreement while korea shall comply with that subparagraph within three years of the entry into force of this agreement. 2. during the transitional period set out in paragraph 1, in so far as korea applies, upon the entry into force of this agreement, mandatory certification to its technical regulations on emc or safety of covered products, including third party testing, for a product falling under the scope of this annex, korea may require to accept such product on its market [6]: (a) a certificate issued by a conformity assessment body in the european union that has been designated as a \"notified body\" according to the legislation of the european union. the european union shall be solely responsible for choosing conformity assessment bodies in its territory, without prior approval or verification by korea, and shall notify korea of its list of relevant bodies upon the entry into force of this agreement and any change thereafter; or (b) a certificate to its technical regulations issued by a conformity assessment body that has been designated according to the procedures of korea. korea shall accept such certificates based on a test report issued by: (i) any testing laboratory in the european union that has concluded voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by korea; or (ii) an eu cb test laboratory under the iecee cb scheme, accompanied by a valid cb test certificate, in accordance with the rules and procedures of the iecee cb scheme and the commitments by the european union and korea thereunder. the choice between the procedures in this subparagraph shall rest with korea subject to the limitations set out in appendix 2-b-2. 3. for those products listed in appendix 2-b-3, korea may continue to require positive assurance of conformity with its technical regulations on safety of covered products on the basis of a certificate in accordance with article 4.2(b) of this annex after the expiry of the transitional period set out in paragraph 1. for each product listed in appendix 2-b-3, it will be reviewed, by the end of the transitional period set out in paragraph 1, whether accepting positive assurance of the conformity of such products with its technical regulations on safety of covered products in accordance with article 3(b) of this annex would create risks for human health and safety. such risk assessment will be conducted for such products on the market, on the basis of available scientific and technical information such as consumer reports on safety accidents and non-conformity rate of product inspection. it will also be considered whether the products are used for their intended end-uses and with reasonable and usual care. if the results of risk assessment demonstrate that complying with article 3(b) of this annex for the products concerned would create risks for human health and safety, or if the post-market surveillance system set up cannot effectively address such risks, positive assurance of conformity as set out in article 4.2(b) of this annex can be maintained. every three years following the end of the transitional period, the parties shall review in the committee on trade in goods the risk assessment with the aim of further reducing products listed in appendix 2-b-3. article 5 consolidation and gradual reduction in requirements 1. the parties shall, for covered products, not maintain or impose any requirements that are more trade-restrictive, or otherwise have the effect of delaying access to their markets, than what is set out in this annex regarding conformity assessment procedures covering emc or safety of covered products or administrative procedures for approving or reviewing test reports. 2. no later than five years after the entry into force of this agreement, korea shall introduce a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity in accordance with article 3(b)(i) of this annex for the placing on the market of some products falling within the scope of this annex. every five years following the introduction of a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity, the parties shall review the possibility of gradually eliminating technical and administrative requirements including mandatory third party testing, through expanding the introduction of a supplier\u2019s declaration of conformity in accordance with article 3(b)(i) of this annex and developing effective market surveillance for the proper functioning of such system. article 6 exceptions and emergency measures 1. notwithstanding articles 3 through 5 of this annex, either party may introduce requirements for mandatory third party testing or certification for emc or safety of covered products, or introduce administrative procedures for approving or reviewing test reports, for particular products falling within the scope of this annex under the following conditions: (a) there exist urgent and compelling reasons related to the protection of human health and safety that justify the introduction of such requirements or procedures; (b) the reasons for the introduction of any such requirements or procedures are supported by substantiated technical or scientific information regarding the performance of the products in question; (c) any such requirements or procedures are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the party\u2019s legitimate objective, taking account of the risks that non-fulfilment would create; and (d) the party could not have reasonably foreseen the need for introducing any such requirements or procedures at the time of entry into force of this agreement. before introducing the requirements or procedures, the party shall notify the other party and, following consultations, take the comments of the other party into account, to the greatest extent possible, in devising any such requirements or procedures. any requirements introduced shall, to the greatest extent possible, be in compliance with this annex. once adopted, any requirement or procedure introduced shall be reviewed every third year from the date of its adoption and repealed if the reasons for its introduction no longer exist. 2. if a party has good cause to believe that a covered product creates risk for human health and safety, notably because it does not comply with requirements applicable to it, the party may require withdrawal of that product from its market. any such temporary emergency measures shall be notified to the other party with an objective and reasoned explanation of why such actions have been taken, indicating whether the need for such measures is due to: (a) failure to comply with applicable standards or technical regulations; (b) incorrect application of standards or technical regulations; or (c) shortcomings in the standards or technical regulations themselves. article 7 implementation and cooperation 1. the parties shall closely cooperate to promote common understanding on regulatory issues, including those related to radio frequency equipment, and consider any request of the other party regarding the implementation of this annex. 2. the parties shall cooperate to maintain and expand the voluntary arrangements for mutual acceptance of test reports between them. 3. whenever korea requires as a positive assurance of conformity the procedures set out in article 3(b)(iii) and article 4.2(b) of this annex for a product falling within the scope of this annex, it shall ensure that its certification bodies have memoranda of understanding (mous) with testing laboratories in the european union, or are national certification bodies under the iecee cb scheme, for that product unless its technical regulations for that product substantially differ from relevant iec standards. this paragraph shall apply as from the expiry of the transitional period set out in article 4.1 of this annex. 4. when amending existing technical regulations or developing any new technical regulation for emc or safety of covered products, a party shall notify the other party in advance, provide, upon request, additional available information or written responses to the comments made by the other party and, as appropriate, consider the other party\u2019s views. 5. the parties agree to consult promptly on any issue that may arise concerning the implementation of this annex, and to cooperate for the further facilitation of trade in covered products, including, as appropriate, through the promotion of international standards. 6. the parties shall protect any confidential business information obtained under the procedures referred to in this annex. [1] the parties may agree in the future by decision of the trade committee on any new international standard-setting bodies which they deem relevant for the purpose of implementing this article. [2] in case no such international standards exist, or where a party has adopted any standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure which differs from that under international standards, the party shall limit its standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure to what is necessary for the achievement of legitimate objectives on safety and other public interest requirements and, wherever appropriate, base them on products requirements in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics, in accordance with chapter four (technical barriers to trade). [3] either party reserves its right to require in the future positive assurance of conformity for any product currently not subject to positive assurance of conformity, in which case the party has to comply with its obligations under this annex. [4] the permission to place a product on the market in accordance with this subparagraph shall include permission to affix any mandatory marks that are required for placing such product on the market. [5] the specific testing laboratories that are competent in the notifying party in accordance with its legislation, that obtain accreditation (for example under iso/iec 17025) by the accreditation body or that are competent for post-market surveillance for conformity assessment in the notifying party, will be considered competent for the task envisaged in this annex. [6] the permission to place a product on the market in accordance with this article shall include permission to affix any mandatory marks that are required for placing the product on the market. -------------------------------------------------- appendix 2-b-1 1. annex 2-b shall cover those products listed in article 1.2 of annex 2-b which: (a) in the case of the european union\u2019s obligations, fall, at the date of signature of this agreement, within the scope of directive 2006/95/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 12 december 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of member states relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits (codified version), or directive 2004/108/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 15 december 2004 on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to electromagnetic compatibility and repealing directive 89/336/eec, or of the provisions on safety or electromagnetic compatibility of directive 1999/5/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 9 march 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity; and (b) in the case of korea\u2019s obligations, fall, at the date of signature of this agreement, within the scope of the radio waves act (act no.8867, feb. 29, 2008), the framework act on telecommunications (act no.8974, mar. 21, 2008) or the electrical appliances safety control act [1] (act no.8852, feb. 29, 2008). 2. the parties understand that the products covered by the domestic laws listed in this appendix, which include all the products to which annex 2-b applies, are intended to cover the universe of electronics products. it is understood that in case a product is not covered by annex 2-b for a party but is covered for the other party, or at the time of signature of this agreement or subsequently [2] subject to mandatory third party certification by a party but not by the other party, the other party can subject such product to a similar treatment as may be necessary for the protection of health and safety. before such measures are implemented, the party wishing to introduce them shall notify the other party of its intentions and provide for a period of three months for consultations.

juridical persons supplying financial services and constituted under the laws of korea are subject to non-discriminatory limitations on juridical form [36].2.the commitments of korea under articles 7.11 and 7.12 are subject to the limitation that in order to establish or acquire a controlling interest in a financial service supplier in korea, a foreign investor must own or control a financial service supplier that engages in supplying financial services within the same financial services sub-sector in its home country.3.for greater certainty, nothing in this agreement limits korea\u2019s ability to require the chief executive officer of a financial service supplier established under its laws to reside within its territory.4.even if korea permits persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service suppliers of the other party located in the territory of the other party, such permission will not mean that korea is required to permit such suppliers to do business or engage in solicitation in the territory of korea. korea may define \"doing business\" and \"solicitation\" for purposes of this obligation, provided that those definitions are not inconsistent with the commitments regarding cross-border supply of financial services undertaken by korea.5.without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation on cross-border supply of financial services, korea may require the registration or authorisation of cross-border financial service suppliers of the other party and of financial instruments. korea may require a cross-border financial service supplier of the other party to provide information, solely for informational or statistical purposes, on the financial services it has supplied within the territory of korea. korea will protect such business information that is confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the supplier.6.the

following:guarantees of loans to or bonds issued by the gsis;permission to issue more bonds per capital than similarly-situated non-gsis;reimbursement of losses incurred by gsis;exemption from certain taxes on capital, surplus, profit, or assets.8.chief and deputy executive officers and all members of the board of directors of the korea housing finance corporation, the national agricultural cooperative federation and the national federation of fisheries cooperatives must be korean nationals.9.korea reserves the right not to consider any \"compulsory\" third-party insurance service supplied in the territory of a foreign country to a natural person in korea or a juridical person established therein, in determining whether such a natural or juridical person has satisfied a legal obligation to purchase such \"compulsory\" third party insurance service not listed in this schedule. however, services supplied outside the territory of korea may be considered in satisfaction of the legal obligation if the required insurance cannot be purchased from an insurer established in korea.10.in the context of privatising government-owned or government-controlled entities that supply financial services, korea reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure relating to the continued guarantee, or time-limited additional guarantee, of the obligations and liabilities of these entities.11.korea reserves the right to limit ownership by foreign investors of the korea exchange and the korea securities depository. in the event of public offering of shares of the korea exchange or the korea securities depository, korea reserves the right to limit shareholding by foreign persons in the relevant institution, provided that korea shall ensure that:(a)any shareholding interests held by foreign persons at the time of the public offering shall be preserved; and(b)following the public offering, the korea exchange or the korea securities depository shall assure access for financial service suppliers of the eu party which are established in korea\u2019s territory, and regulated or supervised under the laws of korea. | a.insurance and insurance-related services [39] |
