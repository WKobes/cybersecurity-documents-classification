(2) a major disruption of the gas supply can affect all member states, the union as a whole and contracting parties to the treaty establishing the energy community, signed in athens on 25 october 2005. it can also severely damage the uni on economy and can have a major social impact, particularly on vulnerable groups of customers. (3) this regulation aims to ensure that all the necessary measures are taken to safeguard an uninterrupted supply of gas throughout the union, in particular to p rotected customers in the event of difficult climatic conditions or disruptions of the gas supply. these objectives should be achieved through the most cost -effective measures and in such a way that gas markets are not distorted. (4) regulation (eu) no 9 94/2010 of the european parliament and of the council of 20 october 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply has already had a significant positive impact on the union situation as regards the security of the gas supply, both in terms o f preparation and mitigation. member states are better prepared to face a supply crisis now that they are required to draw up plans including preventive and emergency measures, and they are better protected now that they have to meet a number of obligation s regarding infrastructure capacity and gas supply. however, the commission's implementation report of regulation (eu) no 994/2010 of october 2014 highlighted areas in which improvements to that regulation could further bolster the union supply security. (5) the commission's communication on the short -term resilience of the european gas system from october 2014 1 analysed the effects of a partial or complete disruption of gas supplies from russia and concluded that purely national approaches are not very ef fective in the event of severe disruption, given their scope, which is by definition limited. this stress test showed how a more cooperative approach among member states could significantly reduce the impact of very severe disruption scenarios in the most vulnerable member states. 1 com(2014) 654 final 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 4 annex dg e2b en (6) the commission communication 'framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward -looking climate change policy' 1 from february 2015, highlights the fact that the energy union rests on solidarity and trust, which a re necessary features of energy security. this regulation should aim to boost solidarity and trust between the member states and should put in place the measures needed to achieve these aims, thus paving the way for implementing the energy union . (7) an in ternal gas market that operates smoothly is the best guarantee of security of energy supply across the union and to reduce the exposure of individual member states to the harmful effects of supply disruptions. where a member state's security of supply is threatened, there is a risk that measures developed unilaterally by that member state may jeopardise the proper functioning of the internal gas market and damage the gas supply to customers in other member states. to allow the internal gas market to functio n even in the face of a shortage of supply, provision must be made for solidarity and coordination in the response to supply crises, as regards both preventive action and the reaction to actual disruptions of supply. (8) so far, the potential for more effi cient and less costly measures through regional cooperation has not been fully exploited. this has to do not only with better coordination of national mitigation actions in emergency situations, but also with national preventive measures, such as nationa l storage or policies related to liquefied natural gas (lng), whic h can be strategically important in certain regions of the union . (9) in a spirit of solidarity, regional cooperation, involving both public authorities and natural gas undertakings, should be the guiding principle of this regulation, to mitigate the identified risks and optimise the benefits of coordinated measures to mitigate them and to implement the most cost -effective measures for union consumers. 1 communication from the commission to the european parliament and the council, the european economic and social committee, the committee of the regions and the european investment bank, com(2015) 80 final. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 5 annex dg e2b en (10) certain customers, including households and customers providing essential social services, are particularly vulnerable and may need protection against the negative effects of a supply disruption . a definition of such protected customers should not confli ct with the union solidarity mechanisms. (11) responsibility for security of gas supply should be shared by natural gas undertakings, member states, acting through their competent authorities , and the commission, within their respective remits. such shared responsibility requires very close cooperation between these parties. however, customers using gas for electricity generation or industrial purposes may also have an important role to play in security of gas supply, as they can respond to a crisis by taki ng demand -side measures such as interruptible contracts and fuel switching, which have an immediate impact on the supply/demand balance . moreover, security of gas supply to certain customers using gas for electricity generation may also be considered to be essential in some cases . it sho uld be possible for a member state to prioritise gas supply to such customers under certain conditions even over the gas supply to the protected customers. this specific measure should leave regulation 2005/89/eu concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment unaffected. (12) as stipulated by directive 2009/73/ec of the european parliament and of the council 1, the competent authorities should cooperate closely with other relevan t national authorities, in particular national regulatory authorities, when carrying out the tasks specified in this regulation. 1 directive 2009/73/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 13 july 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing directive 2003/55/ec (oj l 211, 14.8.2009, p.94). 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 6 annex dg e2b en (13) the infrastructure standard should oblige member states to maintain a minimum level of infrastructure such as to ensure a degree of redundancy in the system in the event of a disruption of the single largest infrastructure. as an analysis done on the basis of the n -1 indicator constitutes a purely capacity -based -approach, the results of n -1 should be complemented with a detailed analysis that also captures gas flows. (14) regulation (eu) no 994/2010 requires transmission system operators to enable permanent physical bi-directional capacity on all cross -border interconnections unless an exemption has been granted from this obligation. it aims to ensure that the possible benefits of permanent physical bi-directional capacity are always taken into account when a new interconnector is planned. however, bi -directional capacity can be used to supply gas both to the neighbouring member state and to others along the gas supply corridor. the benefits for security of supply of enabling permanent bi -directional capacity thus need to be seen in a broader perspective, in a spirit of solidarity and enhanced cooperation. a cost -benefit analysis that takes account of the whole transportation corridor should therefore be conducted when considering whether to implement bi -directional capacity. the competent authorities should accordingly be required to re -examine the exemptions granted under regulation (eu) 994/2010 on the basis of the results of the common risk assessments. (15) council directive 2008/114/ec 1 lays down a process with a view to enhancing the security of designated european critical infrastructure, including certain gas infr astructure, in the union. directive 2008/114/ec together with this regulation contributes to creating a comprehensive approach to the energy security of the union. 1 directive 2008/114/ec of 8 december 2008 on the identification and designation of european critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection (oj l 345, 23.12.2008, p. 75). 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 7 annex dg e2b en (16) the regulation lays down security of supply standards that are sufficiently harmonised and cover at least the situation that occurred in january 2009 when gas supply from russia was disrupted. these standards take account of the difference between member states, public service obligations and customer protection measures, as referred to in article 3 of directive 2009/73/ec. security of supply standards should be stable, so as to provide the necessary legal certainty, should be clearly defined, and should not impose unreasonable and disproportionate burdens on natural gas undertakings. they s hould also guarantee equal access for the union natural gas undertakings to national customers. member states should establish measur es that will in an effective and proportiontate manner ensure that natural gas undertakings comply with such a standard, including the possiblity to establish fines on suppliers, where they consider it appropriate. (17) a risk -based approach to assess the security of supply situation and defin e preventive and miti gating measures enables efforts to be coordinated and bring s significant benefits in terms of the effectiveness of measures and optimisation of resources. this applies particularly to measures designed to guarantee a continued supply, under very demandin g conditions, to protected customers, and to measures to mitigate the impact of an emergency. assessing correlated risks jointly in risk groups which is both more comprehensive and more precise, will ensure that member states are better prepared for any crises. moreover, in an emergency, a coordinated and pre -agreed approach to security of supply ensures a consistent response and reduces the risk of negative spill -over effects that purely national measures could have in neighbouring member states. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 8 annex dg e2b en (18) for the purpose of the risk -based approach risk groups should be defined based on the major transnational risks for the gas supply to the european union . such risks have been identified on the basis of the communication from the commission to the europe an parliament and the council on the short term resilience of the european gas system of october 2014 1 and the assessment included in the latest ten -year network development plan (tyndp). to allow for a more precise and better focused assessment for the pu rposes of this regulation, the risk groups should be composed on the basis of the main gas supply sources and supply routes . (19) the commission should be empowered to update the composition of the risk groups by means of delegated acts based on the evolution of the major transnational risks for security of gas supply to the european union and its impact on member states , taking into account the result of the union -wide simulations of supply and infrastructure disruption scenarios carried out by e ntso for gas and should also reflect the discussion within the gas coordination group . (20) in order to make the regional cooperation feasible, member states should establish a cooperation mechanism within each risk group . such mechanism or mechanisms should be developed sufficiently in time to allow for conducting the common risk assessment and dicussing and agreeing on possible meaningful cross -border measures to be included in the regional chapters in the national pre ventive action and emergency plans . member states are free to agree on a cooperation mechanism best suited for a given risk group . the commission should have a facilitating role in the overall process and share best practises for arranging regional coop eration such as a rotating coordination role within the risk groups for the preparation of the different documents or establishing dedicated bodies. in absence of an agreement on the cooperation mechanism, the commission may propose a suitable cooperation mechanism for a given risk group . 1 communication from the comm ission to the european parliament and the council on the short term resilience of the european gas system. preparedness for a possible disruption of supplies from the east during the fall and winter of 2014/2015, 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 9 annex dg e2b en (21) when conducting the common risk assessment competent authorities should assess the major transnational risks which could materialize including the disruption of the supplies from the single largest supplier . the risks should be addressed by appropriate cross -border measures agreed by the competent authorities of the member states concerned. the cross -border measures should be included in the regional chapters of the preventive action and emergency plans. in ad dition, the competent authorities should conduct a comprehensive national risk assessment and assess natural, technological, commercial, financial, social, political and market -related risks, and any other relevant ones . all risks should be addressed by effective, proportionate and non -discriminatory measures to be developed in the preventive action plan and the emergency plan. the results of the national and common risk assessments should also contribute to the all hazard risk assessments foreseen under article 6 of decision no 1313/2013/eu 1 and should be fully taken into account in the national risk assessments . (22) to provide input to the common and national risk assessments, the european network of transmission system operators for gas ('entso for gas'), in consultation with the gas coordination group and with the european network of transmission system operators for electricity (entso -e), should carry out union -wide simulations . entso for gas shall ensure an appropriate level of transparency and access to its modelling assumptions used in its scenarios. (23) to ensure maximum preparedness, so as to avoid a supply disruption and mitigate its effects should it nevertheless occur, the competent authorities of a given risk group must after consult ing stakeholders draw up national preventive action plans and emergency plans that will contain regional chapters. they should be so designed as to address national risks in a way that takes full advantage of the opportunities provided by regional cooperation. the plans should be technical and operational in nature, their function being to help prevent the occurrence o r escalation of an emergency and to mitigate its effects . the plans should take the security of electricity systems into account and be consistent with the energy union's strategic planning and reporting tools . 1 decision no 1313/2013/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 17 december 2013 on a union civil protection mechanism (oj l 347, 20.12.2013, p. 24). 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 10 annex dg e2b en (24) the roles and responsibilities of all n atural gas undertakings and competent authorities should therefore be defined precisely in order to keep the internal gas market functioning properly, particularly in the event of supply disruptions and crises. such roles and responsibilities should be est ablished in such a way as to ensure that a three -level approach is respected which would involve first the relevant natural gas undertakings and industry, then member states at national or regional level, and then the union. this regulation should enable n atural gas undertakings and customers to rely on market mechanisms for as long as possible when coping with disruptions. however, it should also provide for mechanisms that can be deployed when markets alone are no longer able to deal adequately with a gas supply disruption. (25) in the event of a supply crisis, market players should be given sufficient opportunity to respond to the situation with market -based measures. where market measures have been exhausted and they are still insufficient, member states and their competent authorities should take measures to remove or mitigate the effects of the supply crisis. (26) whenever member states plan to introduce non -market -based measures, such measures should be accompanied by a description of their economic im pact. this ensures customers have the information they need about the costs of such measures and ensures that the measures are transparent, especially as regards their share in the gas price. (28) demand -side measures, such as fuel switching or reducing the gas supply to large industrial consumers in an economically efficient order, may have a valuable role to play in ensuring energy security, if they can be applied quickly and significantly reduce demand in response to a supply disruption. more should be done to promote efficient energy use, particularly where demand -side measures are needed. the environmental impact of any demand and supply -side measures proposed must be taken into account, with preference being given, as far as possible, to measures tha t have least impact on the environment. at the same time, security of supply and competitiveness aspects must be taken into account. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 11 annex dg e2b en (29) when drawing up and implementing the preventive action plan and the emergency plan, the competent authorities should, at all times, take account of the safe operation of the gas system at regional and national levels. they must address and set out in those plans the technical constraints affecting the operation of the network, including any technical and safety reasons f or reducing flows in the event of an emergency. (31) it is necessary to ensure the predictability of the action to take in the event of an emergency, allowing all market participants sufficient opportunity to react and also prepare for such circumstances. as a rule, the competent authorities should therefore abide by their emergency plan. in duly justified exceptional circumstances, they should be allowed to take action which deviates from those plans. it is also important to make the way in which emergencies are announced more transparent and predictable. information on the system balancing position (the overall status of the transmission network), the framework for which is set out in commission regulation (eu) no 312/2014 1, may play an impo rtant role in this regard. that information should be available to competent authorities and the national regulatory authorities, if the latter are not the competent authority on a real time basis. (32) the preventive action plans and emergency plans shoul d be updated regularly and published. (to be joined with recital (32) to ensure that the emergency plans are always up -to-date and effective, member states should carry out tests between the updates of the plans by simulating high and medium -impact sce narios and responses in real time. the competent authorities should present the test results at the gas coordination group . (34) mandatory comprehensive templates including all the risks to be covered by the risk assessment and all the components of the pr eventive action plans and emergency plans are needed to facilitate the risk assessment and preparation of the plans and their assessment by the commission. 1 commission regulation (eu) no 312/2014 of 26 march 2014 establishing a network code on gas balancing of transmission networks (oj l 91 , 27.3.2014, p.15). 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 12 annex dg e2b en (35) to facilitate communication between member states and the commission, the risk assessments, the preventive action plans, the emergency plans and all other documents and information exchanges covered by this regulation must be notified using a standard electronic notification system . (36) as demonstrated by the october 2014 stress test, solidarity is needed to ensure security of supply across the union . solidarity permits the overall costs of the impact of a gas crisis to be limited to the minimum. at the same time, solidarity is a measure of last resort that applies only in an emergency and once all market based measures, and the non -market based measures of the national emergency plan have been exhausted by the member state requesting solidarity . therefore, i f an emergency is declared in a member state, a gradual approach should be applied to ensure security of gas supply . firstly, the member state that declared the emergency should implement all emergency measures provided for in its emergenc y plan in order to ensure gas supply to its households, essential social services and district heating installation. at the same time all member states which have introduced a n increased supply standard should reduce it to the normal supply standard to make the gas market more liquid , in the event that the member state declaring the emergency indicates that cross -border action is required .if the previous two sets of measures fail to provide the necessary supply, solidarity measures by directly connected member states should then be taken to ensure gas supply to households, essential social services and district heating installations in the member state experiencing the emergency ('solidarity measures of last resort') . such solidarity measures of last resort should consist in reducing gas consumption in the member states providing solidarity in order to free up gas volumes that should be supplied to households, essential social services and district heating installations in the member state requesting solidarity. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 13 annex dg e2b en (36a) when solidarity measures of last resort are taken, it is preferable that the gas consumption in the member state providing solidarity is as a first step reduced on voluntary basis, i.e. by means of mark ed-based measures, such as demand -side measures or reversed auctions, in which certain consumers such as industrial consumers would indicate to the transmission system operator or another authority in charge the price at which they would reduce or stop the ir gas consumption. if market -based measures are found to be insufficient to address the deficit of gas supply, should the member state providing solidarity as a second step be able to make use of non -market based measures, including curtailment of certain groups of consumers, in order to comply with its solidarity obligations. (36b) solidarity measures of last resort should be provided on the basis of compensation. in particular, this regulation should ensure that the member state, economic actors and other entities involved in the provision of solidarity are paid promptly a fair compensation. solidarity measures of last resort should hence be subject to the condition that the member state requesting solidarity commits to fair and prompt compensation for the gas delivered into its territory and all other relevant and reasonable costs incurred when providing solidarity. however, this regulation does not harmonise all aspects of compensation. member states receiving and providing solidarity should implement the provisions of this regulation related to compensation in conformity with the treaties and the charter of fundamental rights of the european union and the applicable international obligations. (36ba) since there may be more than one member state which are to provide solidarity to a requesting member state there should be a burden sharing mechanism. under this mechanism, t he member state requesting solidarity should seek supplies of gas from the different helping member s tates on the basis of the gas prices and other costs that would lead to the lowest overall compensation to be paid to the helping member states, unless a different solution is justified by reasons such as speed of delivery, reliability and diversification of supply across the potentially helping member states. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 14 annex dg e2b en however, there should be a deroation from this burden sharing mechanism in order not to p ut an undue burden on a particular member state . this derogation should allow a member state providing solidarity which has delivered a total of 40% of the annual amount of gas consumed by its customers not protected under the solidarity mechanism according to the most recently available data to suspend its gas deliveries to any member state requ esting solidarity .this derogation should not apply if the member state requesting solidarity cannot find another effective solution . neither should such a derogation affect the provision of gas deliveries from the remaining member states providing solidart y un der the burden sharing mechanim . (36c) member states should adopt the necessary measures that make the implementation of solidarity possible, including by directly connected member states agreeing on technical, legal and financial arrangements. member states should describe the details of these arrangements in their emergency plans. in the agreed technical, legal and financial arrangements, member states should be able to limit or suspend the obligation to provide gas in the framework of solidarity. the commission should prepare guidance concerning the key elements that should be included in such arrangements. (36d) for as long as a member state can cover the gas consumption of its customers who are protected in the framework of solidarity from its own production and will therefore not be in need to ask for solidarity, it should to this extent be exempted from the obligation to conclude technical, legal and financial arrangements with directly connected member states for the purpose of receiving solidari ty. this should not affect the obligation of such a memb er state to provide solidarity to other member states. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 15 annex dg e2b en (37) european solidarity should also, where needed, take the form of civil protection assistance provided by the union and its member states. su ch assistance should be facilitated and coordinated by the union civil protection mechanism established by decision no 1313/2013/eu of the european parliament and of the council 1 aiming to strengthen the cooperation between the union and the member states and to facilitate coordination in the field of civil protection in order to improve the effectiveness of systems for preventing, preparing for, and responding to natural and man -made disasters. (38) to assess the security of supply situation of a given mem ber state or part of or in the union as a whole , access to the relevant information is essential. in particular, member states and the commission need regular access to information from natural gas undertakings regarding the main parameters of the gas supply as a fundamental input in the design of the security of supply policies. under duly justified circumstances, irrespective of a declaration of emergency, access should also be possible to additional information needed to assess the overall gas supply situation. that additional information would typic ally be non -price -related gas delivery information, such as minimum and maximum gas volumes, delivery points or conditions for the suspension of gas deliveries . 1 decision no 1313/2013/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 17 december 2013 on a union civil protection mechanism (oj l 347, 20.12.2013, p. 24). 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 16 annex dg e2b en (39) in march 2015, the european council concluded that gas supply contracts with supplier s from third countries should be made more transparent and compatible with the union energy security provisions. in this context an efficient and targeted mechanism for member states' and the commission's access to key gas supply contracts should ensure a comprehensive assessment of relevant risks that can lead to a supply disruption or interfere with the necessary mitigating measures should a crisis nevertheless occur. under that mechanism certain key gas supply contracts should be automatically notified, irrespective of the origin of the gas, within or outside the eu, immediately after their conclusion, to the competent authority of the most affected member state a member state should be considered most affected if a given long -term gas supply contract has delivery points in this member state, or if a contract party of the long -term contract has most of its sales of gas or customers located in this member state. (39a) any obligation to notify a contract automatical ly needs to be proportionate. applying this obligation to contracts between a supplier and a buyer covering the equivalent o f 40% or more of the national market strikes the right balance in terms of administrative efficiency and lays down clear obligations for market participants. this does not mean that other gas supply contracts are not relevant to security of supply. accordingly, where the competent authority or the commission considers that a gas supply contract, which is not subject to automatic notifi cation under article 13(6) might , due to its specificity, customer group served, or security of gas supply relevance , put at risk the security of gas supply of a member state, part of or the union as whole , the compet ent authority or the commission should be able to request relevant parts of this contract in order to assess its impact on security of gas supply. it could, for example, be requested in the event of changes in the pattern of the gas supply to a given buyer or buyers in a member state whi ch would not be expected if the markets were functioning normally and which could affect the gas supply of the union or parts of it. such mechanism will ensure that the access to other key gas supply contracts relevant for security of supply will be guaran teed. such a request should be properly justified, taking into account the need to limit the admin istrative burden of this measure as much as possible . the commission may call on the member states to amend the risk assessments and the prevenive action and emergency plans so as to take account of the information obtained from the contracts. the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information should be ensured. the provisions of this regulation should be without prejudice to the right of the commission to launch infringement proceedings in accordance with article 258 of the 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 17 annex dg e2b en treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu) and to enforce competition rules, including state aid. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 18 annex dg e2b en (40) the gas coordination group should act as an adviser to the commission to help coordinate security of supply measures in the event of a union emergency. it should also monitor the adequacy and appropriateness of measures to be tak en under this regulation, including the consistency of preventive action plans and emergency plans drawn up by different risk groups . (41) a gas crisis might extend beyond union borders comprising also energy community countries. pending further ame ndments to the energy communitytreaty, in order to ensure in the meantime an efficient crisis management on borders between the member states and the contracting parties , they are invited to closely cooperate when preventing, preparing for and handling a gas crisis. (42) since gas supplies from third countries are central to the security of the union gas supply, the commission should coordinate action with regard to third countries, work with supplying and transit countries on arrangements to handle crisi s situations and ensure a stable gas flow to the union. the commission should be entitled to deploy a task force to monitor gas flows into the union in crisis situations, in consultation with member states and the third countries involved, and, where a cri sis arises from difficulties in a third country, to act as mediator and facilitator. the commission sh ould report regularly to the gas coordination group. (43) where there is reliable information on a situation outside the union that threatens the securit y of supply of one or several member states and that may trigger an early warning mechanism involving the union and a third country, the commission should inform the gas coordination group without delay and the union should take appropriate action to try t o defuse the situation. (44) the member states acting on their own cannot satisfactorily achieve the objective of this regulation, namely to guarantee a secure gas supply within the union. given the scale or effects of the action, it is better achieved at union level. the union may therefore adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union. in accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that article, this regulation does no t go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 19 annex dg e2b en (45) in order t o allow for a swift union response to changing circumstances as regards security of gas supply, the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in respect of the composition of the risk groups as well as templates for the risk assessment and for the preventive action and emergency plans. it is of particular importan ce that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level , and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement on better law -making of 13 april 2016. in particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the european parliament and the council receive all documents at the same time as member states' experts, and their experts systematically have access to m eetings of commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts . (45a) member states ' right to determine the conditions for exploitin g their energy resources in accordance with article 194(2) tfeu are not affected by this regulation. (46) regulation (eu) no 994/2010 should be repealed. to avoid legal uncertainty , the preventive action plans and emergency plans drawn up under regulation (ec) no 994/2010 should remain in force until the new preventive action plans and emergency plans draw up under this regulation are adopted for the first time. 9739/7/16 rev 7 bl/ns 20 annex dg e2b en have adopted this regulation: article 1 subject matter this regulation establishes provisions aimed at safeguarding security of gas supply by ensuring the proper and continuous functioning of the internal market in natural gas (\"gas\"), by allowing for exceptional measures to be implemented when the market can no longer deliver the required gas supplies , including solidarity measures as a last resort , and by providing for a clear definition and attribution of responsibilities among natural gas undertakings, the member states and the union regarding both preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply. this regulation also provides transparent mechanisms concerning , in a spirit of solidarity, the coordination of planning for, and response to, an emergency at member state, regional and union levels.
