increase or in the reduction of the margins of preferences provided for under this agreement for the product concerned up to a maximum limit corresponding to the basic duty referred to in article 18 paragraph 4(a) and (b) and paragraph 5 for the same product. such measures shall contain clear elements progressively leading to their elimination at the end of the set period, at the latest, and shall not be taken for a period exceeding two years. in very exceptional circumstances, measures may be extended for a further period of maximum two years. no bilateral safeguard measure shall be

satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the stabilisation and association council, the importing party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem in accordance with this article. in the selection of safeguard measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this agreement. safeguard measures applied in accordance with article xix gatt 1994 and the wto agreement on safeguards shall preserve the level/margin of preference granted under this agreement.

provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves. 3. after four years, the stabilisation and association council shall take the measures necessary to progressively implement the provisions of paragraph 1. account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the parties in the approximation of their laws. article 60 1. the parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by community and serbia nationals or companies which are established in a party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared to the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of this agreement. 2. if one party is of the view that measures introduced by the other party since the entry into force of this agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of this agreement, such first party may request the other party to enter into consultations.

regard to access to ports open to international trade, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading. 4. with a view to ensuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the parties adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access in air transport shall be dealt with by the ecaa. 5. prior to the conclusion of the ecaa, the parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing prior to the entry into force of this agreement. 6. serbia shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the community existing at any time in the field of air, maritime, inland waterway and land transport insofar as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods. 7. in step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the

safeguard measures with regard to movements of capital between the community and serbia for a period not exceeding six months if such measures are strictly necessary. 7. nothing in the above

to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in annex ii are fulfilled. the conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. it follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture. 2. notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that: (a) their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product; (b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph. this paragraph shall not apply to products falling within chapters 50 to 63 of the harmonised system. 3. paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of article 7. article 7 insufficient working or processing 1. without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this article, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of article 6 are satisfied: (a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage; (b) breaking-up and assembly of packages; (c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings; (d) ironing or pressing of textiles; (e) simple painting and polishing operations; (f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice; (g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps; (h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables; (i) sharpening, simple grinding or

on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations; (l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging; (m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any other material; (n) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts; (o) a combination of two or more operations specified in points (a) to (n); (p) slaughter of animals. 2. all operations carried out either in the community or in serbia on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1. article 8 unit of qualification 1. the unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the harmonised system. it follows that: (a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the harmonised system in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification; (b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the harmonised system, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this protocol. 2. where, under general rule 5 of the harmonised system, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin. article 9 accessories, spare parts and tools accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question. article 10 sets sets, as defined in general rule 3 of the harmonised system, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set. article 11 neutral elements in order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture: (a) energy and fuel; (b) plant and equipment; (c) machines and tools; (d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product. title iii territorial requirements article 12 principle of territoriality 1. except as provided for in articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 3 of this article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in title ii must be fulfilled without interruption in the community or in serbia. 2. except as provided for in articles 3 and 4, where originating goods exported from the community or from serbia to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (a) the returning goods are the same as those exported; and (b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported. 3. the acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in title ii shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the community or serbia on materials exported from the community or from serbia and subsequently re-imported there, provided: (a) the said materials are wholly obtained in the community or in serbia or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in article 7 prior to being exported; and (b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (i) the re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials; and (ii) the total added value acquired outside the community or serbia by applying the provisions of this article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed. 4. for the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in title ii shall not apply to working or processing done outside the community or serbia, but where, in the list in annex ii, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the community or serbia by applying the provisions of this article, shall not exceed the stated percentage. 5. for the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, \"total added value\" shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the community or serbia, including the value of the materials incorporated there. 6. the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in annex ii or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in article 6(2) is applied. 7. the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products of chapters 50 to63 of the harmonised system. 8. any working or processing of the kind covered by the provisions of this article and done outside the community or serbia shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements. article 13 direct transport 1. the preferential treatment provided for under this agreement applies only to

set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of: (a) a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or (b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit: (i) giving an exact description of the products; (ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used; and (iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or (c) failing these, any substantiating documents. article 14 exhibitions 1. originating products, sent for exhibition in a country or territory other than those referred to in articles 3 and 4 and sold after the exhibition for importation in the community or in serbia shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (a) an exporter has consigned these products from the community or from serbia to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there; (b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the community or in serbia; (c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and (d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the

the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control. title iv drawback or exemption article 15 prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties 1. non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the community, in serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in articles 3 and 4 for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of title v shall not be subject in the community or in serbia to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind. 2. the prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the community or in serbia to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there. 3. the exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid. 4. the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of article 8(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of article 9 and products in a set within the meaning of article 10 when such items are non-originating. 5. the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which this agreement applies. furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. title v proof of origin article 16 general requirements 1. products originating in the community shall, on importation into serbia and products originating in serbia shall, on importation into the community benefit from this agreement upon submission of either: (a) a movement certificate eur.1, a specimen

notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this article, originating products within the meaning of this protocol shall, in the cases specified in article 27, benefit from this agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to above. article 17 procedure for the issue of a movement certificate eur.1 1. a movement certificate eur.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter\u2019s responsibility, by his authorised representative. 2. for this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate eur.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in annex iii. these forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which this agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. if they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. the description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through. 3. the exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate eur.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate eur.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this protocol. 4. a movement certificate eur.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a member state of the community or of serbia if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the community, serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this protocol. 5. the customs authorities issuing movement certificates eur.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this protocol. for this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter\u2019s accounts or any other check considered appropriate. they shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. in particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions. 6. the date of issue of the movement certificate eur.1 shall be indicated in box 11 of the certificate. 7. a movement certificate eur.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured. article 18 movement certificates eur.1 issued retrospectively 1. notwithstanding article 17(7), a movement certificate eur.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if: (a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or (b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate eur.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons. 2. for the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate eur.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request. 3. the customs authorities may issue a movement certificate eur.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter\u2019s application agrees with that in the corresponding file. 4. movement certificates eur.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with the following phrase in english: \"issued retrospectively\". 5. the endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the \"remarks\" box of the movement certificate eur.1. article 19 issue of a duplicate movement certificate eur.1 1. in the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate eur.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession. 2. the duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with the following word in english: \"duplicate\". 3. the endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the \"remarks\" box of the duplicate movement certificate eur.1. 4. the duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate eur.1, shall take effect as from that date. article 20 issue of movement certificates eur.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously when originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the community or in serbia, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates eur.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the community or serbia. the replacement movement certificate(s) eur.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed. article 21 accounting segregation 1. where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called \"accounting segregation\" method to be used for managing such stocks. 2. this method must be able to ensure that, for a specific reference-period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as \"originating\" is the same as that which would have been obtained if there had been physical segregation of the stocks. 3. the customs authorities may grant such authorisation, subject to any conditions deemed appropriate. 4. this method is recorded and applied on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured. 5. the beneficiary of this facilitation may issue or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. at the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed. 6. the customs authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation and may withdraw it at any time whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this protocol. article 22 conditions for making out an invoice declaration 1. an invoice declaration as referred to in article 16(1)(b) may be made out: (a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of article 23, or (b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed eur 6000. 2. an invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the community, in serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this protocol. 3. the exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this protocol. 4. an invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in annex iv, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that annex and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. if the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in printed characters. 5. invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. however, an approved exporter within the meaning of article 23 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him. 6. an invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates. article 23 approved exporter 1. the customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter, hereinafter referred to as \"approved exporter\", who makes frequent shipments of products under this agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. an exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this protocol. 2. the customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate. 3. the customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration. 4. the customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter. 5. the customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. they shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation. article 24 validity of proof of origin 1. a proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country. 2. proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. 3. in other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date. article 25 submission of proof of origin proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. the said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this agreement. article 26 importation by instalments where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of general rule 2(a) of the harmonised system falling within sections xvi and xvii or headings 7308 and 9406 of the harmonised system are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment. article 27 exemptions from proof of origin 1. products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers\u2019 personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. in the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration cn22/cn23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document. 2. imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view. 3. furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed eur 500 in the case of small packages or eur 1200 in the case of products forming part of travellers\u2019 personal luggage. article 28 supporting documents+ the documents referred to in articles 17(3) and 22(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate eur.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the community, in serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this protocol may consist, inter alia, of the following: (a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book-keeping; (b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the community or in serbia

referred to in article 22(3). 3. the customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate eur.1 shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in article 17(2). 4. the customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates eur.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them. article 30 discrepancies and formal errors 1. the discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted. 2. obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document. article 31 amounts expressed in euro 1. for the application of the provisions of article 22(1)(b) and article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the member states of the community, of serbia and of the other countries or territories referred to in articles 3 and 4 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned. 2. a consignment shall benefit from the provisions of article 22(1)(b) or article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the country concerned. 3. the amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of october. the amounts shall be communicated to the european commission by 15 october and shall apply from 1 january the following year. the european commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts. 4. a country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. the rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. a country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. the national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value. 5. the amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the stabilisation and association committee at the request of the community or of serbia. when carrying out this review, the stabilisation and association committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. for this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro. title vi arrangements for administrative cooperation article 32 mutual assistance 1. the customs authorities of the member states of the community and of serbia shall provide each other, through the european commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates eur.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations. 2. in order to ensure the proper application of this protocol, the community and serbia shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates eur.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents. article 33 verification of proofs of origin 1. subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this protocol. 2. for the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate eur.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification. 3. the verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. for this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter\u2019s accounts or any other check considered appropriate. 4. if the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. 5. the customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. these results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the community, in serbia or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this protocol. 6. if in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences. article 34 dispute settlement where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of article 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this protocol, they shall be submitted to the stabilisation and association committee. in all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country. article 35 penalties penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products. article 36 free zones 1. the community and serbia shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration. 2. by means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the community or in serbia are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate eur.1 at the exporter\u2019s request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this protocol. title vii ceuta and melilla article 37 application of this protocol 1. the term \"community\" used in article 2 does not cover ceuta or melilla. 2. products originating in serbia, when imported into ceuta and melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the community under protocol 2 of the act of accession of the kingdom of spain and the portuguese republic to the european communities. serbia shall grant to imports of products covered by this agreement and originating in ceuta and melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the community. 3. for the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in ceuta and melilla, this protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in article 38. article 38 special conditions 1. providing they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of article 13, the following shall be considered as: 1.1. products originating in ceuta and melilla: (a) products wholly obtained in ceuta and melilla; (b) products obtained in ceuta and melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that: (i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of article 6; or that (ii) those products are originating in serbia or in the community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in article 7; 1.2. products originating in serbia: (a) products wholly obtained in serbia; (b) products obtained in serbia, in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in point (a) are used, provided that: (i) the said products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of article 6; or that (ii) those products are originating in ceuta and melilla or in the community, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in article 7. 2. ceuta and melilla shall be considered as a single territory. 3. the exporter or his authorised representative shall enter \"serbia\" and \"ceuta and melilla\" in box 2 of movement certificates eur. 1 or on invoice declarations. n addition, in the case of products originating in ceuta and melilla, this shall be indicated in box 4 of movement certificates eur.1 or on invoice declarations. 4. the spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this protocol in ceuta and melilla. title viii final provisions article 39 amendments to this protocol the stabilisation and association council may decide to amend the provisions of this protocol. [1] as defined in the conclusions of the general affairs council in april 1997 and commission communication of may 1999 on the establishment of the stabilisation and association process with western balkan countries. [2] decision 1/95/ec of the ec-turkey association council of 22 december 1995 applies to products other than agricultural products as defined in the agreement establishing an association between the european economic community and turkey and other than coal and steel products as defined in the agreement between the european coal and steel community and the republic of turkey on trade in products covered by the treaty establishing the european coal and steel community. -------------------------------------------------- annex i to protocol 3 introductory notes to the list in annex ii note 1 the list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of article 6 of protocol 3. note 2 2.1. the first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. the first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the harmonised system and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. for each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an \"ex\", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 2.2. where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the harmonised system, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1. 2.3. where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4. 2.4. where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. if no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied. note 3 3.1. the provisions of article 6 of protocol 3, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a contracting party. example: an engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from \"other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging\" of heading ex7224. if this forging has been forged in the community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex7224 in the list. the forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the community. the value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used. 3.2. the rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not. 3.3. without prejudice to note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading\", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. however, the expression \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading \u2026\" or \"manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product\" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list. 3.4. when a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. it does not require that all be used. example: the rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. this does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both. 3.5. where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (see also note 6.2 below in relation to textiles). example: the rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals. however, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture. example: in the case of an article of apparel of ex chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth \u2013 even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. in such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn \u2013 that is, the fibre stage. 3.6. where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. in other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply. note 4 4.1. the term \"natural fibres\" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. it is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun. 4.2. the term \"natural fibres\" includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305. 4.3. the terms \"textile pulp\", \"chemical materials\" and \"paper-making materials\" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 4.4. the term \"man-made staple fibres\" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507. note 5 5.1. where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (see also notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.) 5.2. however, the tolerance mentioned in note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials. the following are the basic textile materials: - silk, - wool, - coarse animal hair, - fine animal hair, - horsehair, - cotton, - paper-making materials and paper, - flax, - true hemp, - jute and other textile bast fibres, - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus agave, - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres, - synthetic man-made filaments, - artificial man-made filaments, - current-conducting filaments, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide), - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride), - other synthetic man-made staple fibres, - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose, - other artificial man-made staple fibres, - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped, - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped, - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, - other products of heading 5605. example: a yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn. example: a woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric. example: tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures. example: if the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product. 5.3. in the case of products incorporating \"yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped\", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn. 5.4. in the case of products incorporating \"strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film\", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip. note 6 6.1. where, in the list, reference is made to this note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product. 6.2. without prejudice to note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles. example: if a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within chapters 50 to 63. for the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles. 6.3. where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated. note 7 7.1. for the purposes of headings ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, the \"specific processes\" are the following: (a) vacuum-distillation; (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process; (c) cracking; (d) reforming; (e) extraction by means of selective solvents; (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerisation; (h) alkylation; (i) isomerisation. 7.2. for the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the \"specific processes\" are the following: (a) vacuum-distillation; (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process; (c) cracking; (d) reforming; (e) extraction by means of selective solvents; (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerisation; (h) alkylation; (i) isomerisation; (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur-content of the products processed (astm d 1266-59 t method); (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering; (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \u00b0c, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. the further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process; (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 \u00b0c, by the astm d 86 method; (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge; (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation. 7.3. for the purposes of headings ex2707, 2713 to 2715, ex2901, ex2902 and ex3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin. -------------------------------------------------- annex ii to protocol 3 list of working or processing required to be carried out on

infrastructure as part of the modernisation of the railways of serbia, the necessary steps shall be taken to adapt the system for combined transport, with particular regard to the development or building of terminals, tunnel gauges and capacity, which require substantial investment. article 9 supporting measures the parties shall take all the steps necessary to encourage the development of combined transport. the purpose of such measures shall be: - to encourage the use of combined transport by users and consignors, - to make combined transport competitive with road transport, in particular through the financial support of the community or serbia in the context of their respective legislation, - to encourage the use of combined transport over long distances and to promote, in particular the use of swap bodies, containers and unaccompanied transport in general, - to improve the speed and reliability of combined transport and in particular: - to increase the frequency of convoys in accordance with the needs of consignors and users, - to reduce the waiting time at terminals and increase their productivity, - to remove in an appropriate manner, all obstacles from the approach routes so as to improve access to combined transport, - to harmonise, where necessary, the weights, dimensions and technical characteristics of specialised equipment, in particular so as to ensure the necessary compatibility of gauges, and to take coordinated action to order and to put into service such equipment as is required by the level of traffic, - and, in general, to take any other appropriate action. article 10 the role of the railways in connection with the respective powers of the states and the railways, the parties shall, in respect of both passenger and goods transport, recommend that their railways: - step up cooperation, whether bilateral, multilateral or within international railway organisations, in all fields, with particular regard to the improvement of the quality and the safety of transport services, - try to establish in common a system of organising the railways so as to encourage consignors to send freight by rail rather than road, in particular for transit purposes, on a basis of fair competition and while leaving the user freedom of choice in this matter, - prepare the participation of serbia in the implementation and future evolution of the community acquis on the development of the railways. road transport article 11 general provisions 1. with regard to mutual access to transport markets, the parties agree, initially and without prejudice to paragraph 2, to maintain the regime resulting from bilateral agreements or other existing international bilateral instruments concluded between each member state of the community and serbia or, where there are no such agreements or instruments, arising from the de facto situation in 1991. however, whilst awaiting the conclusion of agreements between the community and serbia on access to the road transport market, as provided for in article 12, and on road taxation, as provided for in article 13(2), serbia shall cooperate with the member states of the community to amend these bilateral agreements to adapt them to this protocol. 2. the parties hereby agree to grant unrestricted access to community transit traffic through serbia and to serbian transit traffic through the community with effect from the date of entry into force of this agreement. 3. if, as a result of the rights granted under paragraph 2, transit traffic by community hauliers increases to such a degree as to cause or threaten to cause serious harm to road infrastructure and/or traffic fluidity on the axes mentioned in article 5, and under the same circumstances problems arise on community territory close to the borders of serbia, the matter shall be submitted to the stabilisation and association council in accordance with article 121 of this agreement. the parties may propose exceptional temporary, non-discriminatory measures as are necessary to limit or mitigate such harm. 4. if the community establishes rules aiming to reduce pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles registered in the european union and to improve traffic safety, a similar regime shall apply to heavy goods vehicles registered in serbia that wish to circulate through the community territory. the

of the common transport policy and, on the other hand, with economic and transport policies of serbia, - a definitive system for regulating future road transport market access between parties on the basis of reciprocity. article 13 taxation, tolls and other charges 1. the parties accept that the taxation of road vehicles, tolls and other charges on either side must be non-discriminatory. 2. the parties shall enter into negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on road taxation, as soon as possible, on the basis of the rules adopted by the community on this matter. the purpose of this

distortions of competition arising from such differences. 3. pending the conclusion of the negotiations mentioned in paragraph 2 of this article, the parties will eliminate discrimination between hauliers of the community and serbia when levying taxes and charges on the circulation and/or possession of heavy goods vehicles as well as taxes or charges levied on transport operations in the territory of the parties. serbia undertakes to notify the european commission, if so requested, the amount of taxes, tolls and charges which they apply, as well as the methods of calculating them. 4. until the conclusion of the agreement mentioned in paragraph 2 and in article 12 any change proposed after the entry into force of this agreement to fiscal charges, tolls or other charges, including the systems for their collection which may be applied to community traffic in transit through serbia will be subject to a prior consultation procedure. article 14 weights and dimensions 1. serbia accepts that road vehicles complying with community standards on weights and dimensions may circulate freely and without hindrance in this respect on the routes covered by article 5. during six months after the entry into force of this agreement, road vehicles which do not comply with existing standards of serbia may be subject to a special non-discriminatory charge which reflects the damage caused by additional axle weight. 2. serbia will endeavour to harmonise their existing regulations and standards for road construction with the legislation prevailing in the community by the end of the fifth year after the entry into force of this agreement and will make major efforts for improvement of the existing routes covered by article 5 to those new regulations and standards within the proposed time, in accordance with their financial possibilities. article 15 environment 1. in order to protect the environment, the parties shall endeavour to introduce standards on gaseous and particulate emissions and noise levels for heavy goods vehicles, which ensure a high level of protection. 2. in order to provide the industry with clear information and to encourage coordinated research, programming and production, exceptional national standards in this field shall be avoided. 3. vehicles which comply with standards laid down by international agreements also relating to environment may operate without further restrictions in the territory of the parties. 4. for the purpose of introducing new standards, the parties shall work together to achieve the abovementioned objectives. article 16 social aspects 1. serbia shall harmonise their legislations on the training of road haulage personnel, particularly with respect to the carriage of dangerous goods, to the community

the need that serbia addresses promptly any structural weaknesses of its steel sector to ensure the global competitiveness of its industry. 2. further to the disciplines stipulated by paragraph 1(iii) of article 73 of this agreement, the assessment of the compatibility of state aid to the steel industry as defined in annex i of the guidelines on national regional aid for 2007\u201313 shall be made on the basis of the criteria arising from the application of article 87 of the ec treaty to the steel sector, including secondary legislation. 3. for the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii) of article 73 of this agreement with regard to the steel industry, the community recognises that, during five years after the entry into force of this agreement, serbia may exceptionally grant state aid for restructuring purposes to steel producing firms in difficulties, provided that: (a) it leads to the long-term viability of the benefiting firms under normal market conditions at the end of the restructuring period; and (b) the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore such viability, and aid is where appropriate progressively reduced; (c) serbia presents restructuring programmes that are linked to a global rationalisation which includes the closing of inefficient capacity. every steel producing firm benefiting from restructuring aid shall, as far as possible, provide for compensatory measures balancing the distortion of competition caused by the aid. 4. serbia shall submit to the european commission for assessment a national restructuring programme and individual business plans for each of the companies benefiting from restructuring aid which demonstrate that the above conditions are fulfilled. the individual business plans shall have been assessed and agreed by the state aid monitoring authority of serbia in view of their compliance with paragraph 3 of this protocol. the european commission shall confirm that the national restructuring programme is in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 3. 5. the european commission shall monitor the implementation of the plans, in close cooperation with the competent national authorities, in particular the state aid monitoring authority of serbia. if the monitoring indicates that aid to the beneficiaries which is not approved in the national restructuring programme or any restructuring aid to steel firms not identified in the national restructuring programme has been granted from the date of signature of this agreement onwards, the state aid monitoring authority of serbia shall ensure that any such aid is reimbursed. 6. upon request, the community shall provide serbia with technical support for the preparation of the national restructuring programme and the individual business plans. 7. each party shall ensure full transparency with respect to state aid. in particular, as regards state aid granted to steel production in serbia and the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plans, a full and continuous exchange of information shall take place. 8. the stabilisation and association council shall monitor the implementation of the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above. to this effect, the stabilisation and association council may draft implementing rules. 9. if one of the parties considers that a particular practice of the other party is incompatible with the terms of this protocol, and if that practice causes or threatens to cause prejudice to the interests of the first party or material injury to its domestic industry, this party may take appropriate measures after consultation within the subcommittee dealing with competition matters or after thirty working days following referral for such consultation. -------------------------------------------------- protocol 6 on mutual administrative assistance in customs

+++++ -------------------------------------------------- joint declarations joint declaration on article 3 the parties to this stabilisation and association agreement, the european communities and their member states, of the one part, and the republic of serbia, of the other part, consider that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (hereinafter referred to as \"wmd\") and their means of delivery, both at state and non-state actors level, represents one of the most serious threats to international peace, stability and security as confirmed by united nations security council adopted resolution 1540(2004). non-proliferation of wmd is therefore a joint concern for the european communities and their member states and serbia. the fight against the proliferation of wmd and their means of delivery also constitutes a fundamental element for the european union when it considers the decision of entering into an agreement with a third country. this is why the council decided on 17 november 2003 that a non-proliferation clause should be inserted in the new agreements with third countries and agreed on a text of standard clause (see council document 14997/03). such a clause has since been inserted in the european union\u2019s agreements with nearly one hundred countries. the european union and the republic of serbia, as responsible members of the international community, reaffirm their full commitment to the principle of non-proliferation of the wmd and their means of delivery and to the full implementation of their international obligations arising out of international instruments to which they adhere. it is in this spirit and in line with the above stated general eu policy and serbian commitment to the principle of non-proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, both parties agreed to include, in article 3 of this agreement, the standard clause on wmd as set out by the council of the european union. joint declaration on article 32 the purpose of measures defined in article 32 is to monitor the trade of products with high content of sugar that could be used for further processing and to prevent the possible distortion in patterns of trade of sugar and products not having characteristics essentially different to the characteristics of sugar. that article should be interpreted in such a manner that does not disturb or disturbs to the least possible scale the trade in products intended for final consumption. joint declaration on article 75 the parties agree that for the purpose of this agreement, intellectual and industrial property includes in particular copyright, including the copyright in computer programmes, and neighbouring rights, the rights relating to databases, patents including supplementary protection certificates, industrial designs, trademarks and service marks, topographies of integrated circuits, geographical indications, including appellation of origins, and plant variety rights. the protection of commercial property rights includes in particular the protection against unfair competition as referred to in article 10bis of the paris convention for the protection of industrial property and the protection of undisclosed information as referred to in article 39 of the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights (trips agreement). the parties further agree that the level of protection referred to in article 75, paragraph 3, shall include the availability of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in directive 2004/48/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 29 april 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights [1]. declaration by the community and its member states considering that exceptional trade measures are granted by the community to countries participating or linked to the eu stabilisation and association process including serbia on the basis of regulation (ec) no 2007/2000, the community and its member states declare: - that, in application of article 35 of this agreement, those of the unilateral autonomous trade measures which are more favourable shall apply in addition to the contractual trade concessions offered by the community in this agreement as long as council regulation (ec) no 2007/2000 of 18 september 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the european union\u2019s stabilisation and association process [2], applies, - that, in particular, for the products covered by chapters 7 and 8 of the combined nomenclature, for which the common customs tariff provides for the application of ad valorem customs duties and a specific customs duty, the reduction shall apply also to the specific customs duty in derogation from the relevant provision of article 26 paragraph 2.
