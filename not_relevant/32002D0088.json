(2) regulation (ec) no 622/98 sets out that the council is to decide, by a qualified majority and following a proposal from the commission, on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the individual accession partnerships, as they are submitted to each applicant state, as well as on subsequent significant adjustments applicable to them. (3) community assistance is conditional on the fulfilment of essential elements, and in particular on the respect of the commitments contained in the europe agreements and on progress towards fulfilment of the copenhagen criteria; where an essential element is lacking, the council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the commission, may take appropriate steps with regard to any pre-accession assistance. (4) the luxembourg european council decided that the implementation of the accession partnership and progress in adopting the acquis will be examined in the europe agreement bodies. (5) the 2001 commission's regular report presents an objective analysis on latvia's preparations for membership and identifies a number of priority areas for further work. (6) in order to prepare for membership, latvia should continue to update its national programme for the adoption of the acquis; this programme should set out a timetable for achieving the priorities and intermediate objectives established in the accession partnership. (7) latvia needs to ensure that the appropriate legal and administrative structures needed for the programming, coordination, management, control and evaluation of community pre-accession funds are in place, has decided as follows: article 1 in accordance with article 2 of regulation (ec) no 622/98, the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions in the accession partnership for latvia are set out in the annex hereto, which forms an integral part of this decision. article 2 the implementation of the accession partnership shall be examined in the europe agreement bodies and by the appropriate council bodies to which the commission shall report regularly. article 3 this decision shall take effect on the third day following its publication in the official journal of the european communities. done at brussels, 28 january 2002. for the council the president j. piqu\u00e9 i camps (1) oj l 85, 20.3.1998, p. 1. annex 1. introduction at its meeting in luxembourg in december 1997, the european council decided that the accession partnership would be the key feature of the enhanced pre-accession strategy, mobilising all forms of assistance to the candidate countries within a single framework. in this manner, the community targets its assistance towards the specific needs of each candidate so as to provide support for overcoming particular problems with a view to accession. the first accession partnership for latvia was decided in march 1998. as provided for in regulation (ec) no 622/98 (article 2), the accession partnership was updated a first time in december 1999, taking into account further developments in latvia. the present revision is based on a proposal by the commission following consultation with latvia, and draws on the analysis of the commission's 2001 regular report on progress made by latvia towards accession. 2. objectives the purpose of the accession partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the commission's 2001 regular reports on the progress made by latvia towards membership of the union, the financial means available to help latvia implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. the accession partnership provides the basis for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate states in their preparations for membership. these include, inter alia, the updated national programme for the adoption of the acquis prepared by latvia, the pre-accession fiscal surveillance procedure, the pre-accession economic programme, the pre-accession pact on organised crime as well as the national development plans, the rural development plans, a national employment strategy in line with the european employment strategy, and sectoral plans necessary for the participation in the structural funds after membership and for the implementation of ispa and sapard before accession. each of these instruments is different in nature and is prepared and implemented according to specific procedures and may be supported by pre-accession aid. they are not an integral part of this partnership but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it. 3. principles the main priority areas identified for each candidate state relate to their ability to take on the obligations of meeting the copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires: - that the candidate state has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, - the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union, - the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. at its meeting in madrid in 1995, the european council stressed the need for the candidate states to adjust their administrative structures to ensure harmonious operation of community policies after accession and at luxembourg, in 1997, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied. the feira and gothenburg european councils in 2000 and 2001 respectively confirmed the vital importance of the applicant countries' capacity to implement and enforce the acquis, and added that this required important efforts by the applicants in strengthening and reforming their administrative and judicial structures. 4. priorities and intermediate objectives the commission's regular reports have highlighted, besides the progress already made, the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by candidate states to prepare for accession. this situation requires the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the states concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with latvia. the priorities listed in the revised accession partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that latvia can complete or take them substantially forward over the next two years (2002 to 2003). within this list, issues that require particularly urgent action have been highlighted as such. the progress made in meeting the priorities of the 1999 accession partnership is assessed in the 2001 regular report. this assessment has been used in formulating the priorities for the current partnership. latvia submitted an updated version of its national programme for the adoption of the acquis (npaa) in july 2001. the npaa sets out a timetable for achieving priorities and intermediate objectives, based on the 1999 accession partnership, as well as necessary administrative structures and financial resources. the accession partnership indicates the priority areas for latvia's membership preparations. latvia will nevertheless have to address all issues identified in the 2001 regular report. it is also important that latvia fulfils the commitments of legislative approximation and the implementation of the acquis in accordance with the commitments made under the europe agreement, and in the context of the negotiation process. it should be recalled that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the union. in all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis. drawing on the analysis of the commission's regular report, the following priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for latvia. these priorities are presented in accordance with the structure of the regular report(1). political criteria democracy and the rule of law - accelerate efforts to develop a professional and stable civil service at all levels of the public administration, including a sound remuneration system. ensure minimum staffing levels, training, and adequate financial resources at all levels of the public administration with a view to strengthening the capacity to implement the acquis, - continue to strengthen the judicial system, including completion of legal framework (law on criminal procedure and law on administrative procedure), alleviation of courts' workload, elimination of backlog of pending court cases and ensuring the enforcement of court decisions. strengthen training and increase remuneration of judges. improve the infrastructure, including court buildings, to ensure the due functioning of the courts. promote access to justice, - complete the legal framework for the fight against all types of corruption and ensure implementation of legislation, as well as the anti-corruption strategy. improve interagency and international cooperation. human rights and the protection of minorities - address the issue of pre-trial detention, - ensure implementation of the language law and its implementing regulations in line with the principle of proportionality, international standards, and the europe agreement, - continue to implement further concrete measures for the integration of non-citizens, on the basis of the national programme \"the integration of society in latvia\", including language training and information campaigns, and provide the necessary financial support. economic criteria - complete privatisation of the remaining large enterprises, - continue to strengthen land market and finalise the land and property register, - further promote competitiveness, notably through measures aimed at stimulating domestic and inward investment in growth-generating activities, - improve business environment, in particular through the removal of the remaining regulatory and administrative constraints to enterprise developments. ability to assume the obligations of membership free movement of goods - complete alignment of public procurement legislation and ensure implementation at all levels, - complete the process of transposition and implementation of all \"new approach\" and sectoral legislation with the acquis;
