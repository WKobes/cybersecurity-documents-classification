(a) the management\u2019s responsibilities in respect of the agency's annual accounts include designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies on the basis of the accounting rules adopted by the commission\u2019s accounting officer ( 6 ) ; making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. the executive director approves the annual accounts of the agency after its accounting officer has prepared them on the basis of all available information and established a note to accompany the accounts in which he declares, inter alia, that he has reasonable assurance that they present a true and fair view of the financial position of the agency in all material respects. (b) the management\u2019s responsibilities in respect of the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and compliance with the principle of sound financial management consist of designing, implementing and maintaining an effective and efficient internal control system comprising adequate supervision and appropriate measures to prevent irregularities and fraud and, if necessary, legal proceedings to recover funds wrongly paid or used. the auditor\u2019s responsibility 5. the court\u2019s responsibility is, on the basis of its audit, to provide the european parliament and the council ( 7 ) with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. the court conducts its audit in accordance with the ifac international standards on auditing and codes of ethics and the intosai international standards of supreme audit institutions. these standards require the court to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the annual accounts of the agency are free from material misstatement and the transactions underlying them are legal and regular. 6. the audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. the procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, which is based on an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the accounts and material non-compliance by the underlying transactions with the requirements in the legal framework of the european union, whether due to fraud or error. in assessing these risks, the auditor considers any internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the accounts, as well as the supervisory and control systems that are implemented to ensure the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, and designs audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. the audit also entails evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies, the reasonableness of accounting estimates and the overall presentation of the accounts. in preparing this report and statement of assurance, the court considered the audit work of the independent external auditor performed on the agency\u2019s accounts as stipulated in article 208(4) of the eu financial regulation ( 8 ) . 7. the court considers that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for its statement of assurance. opinion on the reliability of the accounts 8. in the court\u2019s opinion, the annual accounts of the agency present fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as at 31 december 2014 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the provisions of its financial regulation and the accounting rules adopted by the commission\u2019s accounting officer. opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts 9. in the court\u2019s opinion, the transactions underlying the annual accounts for the year ended 31 december 2014 are legal and regular in all material respects. emphasis of matter in relation to the reliability of the accounts 10. without calling into question the opinion expressed in paragraph 8, the court draws attention to the valuation of the schengen information system (sis ii), the visa information system (vis) and eurodac (systems) in the agency\u2019s accounts. the operational management of these systems is the agency\u2019s core task. in the absence of reliable and complete information in respect of their total development cost, they are recorded in the agency\u2019s accounts at their net book values as per the commission\u2019s books and updated at year end (approximately 6,6 million euro at date of transfer and 2,1 million euro at 31 december 2014). these values relate mainly to hardware and off-the-shelf software components and do not include software development costs (see note 6.3.1 to the annual accounts of the agency). 11. the comments which follow do not call the court\u2019s opinion on the reliability of the accounts and its opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts into question. comments on budgetary management 12. out of the 6,6 million euro committed appropriations for titles i (staff expenditure) and ii (administrative expenditure) which were carried over from 2013 to 2014, 1,7 million euro (26 %) were cancelled in 2014, showing that budgetary needs were overestimated at the end of 2013. 13. committed appropriations carried over to 2015 were very high for title ii (administrative expenditure) at 15 million euro, i.e. 87 % (2013: 6 million euro or 79 %). these carry-overs mainly resulted from delayed procurements for the extension and refurbishment of the agency\u2019s site in strasbourg. carry-overs of committed appropriations were also high for title iii (operational expenditure) at 24,5 million euro (85 %) (2013: no comparative figures available), mainly in relation to multi-annual contracts for the maintenance of the it systems. the high levels of cancelled carry-overs from 2013 and the extent of carry-overs made from 2014 to 2015 is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality. reliable procedures for budget planning, execution and monitoring need to be put in place. follow-up of previous year\u2019s comments 14. an overview of the corrective actions taken in response to the court's comments from the previous year is provided in annex i . this report was adopted by chamber iv, headed by mr milan martin cvikl, member of the court of auditors, in luxembourg

of corrective action (completed/ongoing/outstanding/n/a) 2013 emphasis of matter in relation to the reliability of the accounts 11. without calling into question the opinion expressed in paragraph 9, the court draws attention to the valuation of the schengen information system (sis ii), the visa information system (vis) and eurodac (systems) in the agency\u2019s accounts. the operational management of these systems was transferred to the agency from the commission in may 2013 by way of a non-exchange transaction and is the core task of the agency. in the absence of reliable and complete information in respect of their total development cost, they are recorded in the agency\u2019s accounts at their net book values as per the commission\u2019s books and updated at year end. these values relate mainly to hardware and off-the-shelf software components and do not include software development costs (see note 6.3.1 to the annual accounts of the agency). n/a 2013 the development of the agency\u2019s internal control standards was ongoing at the end of the year. they were approved by the management board in june 2014. completed 2013 there is no insurance coverage for fixed tangible assets, except for multi-risk fire for the premises in tallinn. ongoing 2013 according to the agency\u2019s founding regulation, the commission was responsible for the establishment and initial operation of the agency until it was granted financial autonomy on 22 may 2013. the migration of data on commitment and payment appropriations from the commission to the agency was a complex process and a reconciliation of the figures between the commission\u2019s and the agency\u2019s accounting systems was finally completed in june 2014. this affected the agency\u2019s payment planning and the preparation of its provisional accounts. n/a 2013 according to the agency\u2019s final accounts budget implementation rates were 96 % for commitment appropriations and 67 % for payment appropriations. due to the fact that part of the agency\u2019s total annual budget was executed by the commission and the differences between the commission\u2019s and the agency\u2019s budgetary structures, a more detailed analysis per budget title could not be carried out for 2013. n/a 2013 according to the agency\u2019s founding regulation, countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the schengen acquis and eurodac-related measures must make a contribution to the agency\u2019s budget. although schengen associated countries were using the systems managed by the agency in 2013 the commission\u2019s negotiations were still ongoing. ongoing 2013 though the seat of the agency is in tallinn (with 46 occupied posts), operational activities are carried out in strasbourg (with 79 occupied posts). it is likely that management effectiveness could be increased and administrative costs reduced if all staff were centralised in one location. n/a (not under the agency\u2019s control) 2013 a headquarters agreement that would clarify the conditions under which the agency and its staff operate has not yet been signed with the host member state, estonia, and negotiations were still ongoing at the time of the audit. completed annex ii eu agency for the operational management of large scale it systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (tallinn) competences and activities areas of union competence deriving from the treaty (article 74, 77(2)(a) and (b), 78(2)(e), 79(2)(c), 82(1)(d), 85(1), 87(2)(a) and article 88(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union) contribute to the creation of an area of free circulation of people by increasing cooperation on cross-border issues, such as asylum,

agency. the agency\u2019s reply 10. the agency notes the matter highlighted by the court. it is anticipated that the net book value of these migrated assets will be less than 2 00 000 euro at 31 december 2015. 12. the agency acknowledges the comment. upon becoming financial independent in 2013, a number of commitments for administrative expenditure were migrated from dg home to the agency. the business case supporting these commitments did not always prove relevant in the new organisational/logistical set up of the agency. in addition to that, by the time the decision for carry-forward was made, the agency had still not attained its full staff complement, so that budget management capacity was limited in some areas. the agency has meanwhile significantly improved its capacity to monitor and implement carry-forwards. it is expected that the volume and percentage of cancellations will decrease in 2015 compared to 2014. 13. the agency recognises the importance of accurate budget planning and has taken steps to improve its capacity to plan, monitor and implement available appropriations. closer coordination between the operational and administrative functions, the further design of effective internal controls, as well as the progressive increase in the agency\u2019s experience and expertise after financial independence in 2013, are all expected to contribute to an improved control of the budget implementation cycle. in addition to that, specific organisational measures, including the formalisation of budget line ownership and responsibility at the level of operational verification, the establishment of a budget officer post, regular budget implementation reporting, are being implemented to support improved control over budget control and monitoring. the agency closely followed the financial regulation as regards carry-forwards, resulting in both automatic and non-automatic carry-overs as allowed by the applicable rules on annuality. as regards non-automatic carry-overs for the strasbourg site, these were approved by the management board based on a duly justified proposal by the agency in compliance with applicable rules. the differentiated nature of appropriations in title iii should be highlighted when assessing of the volume of commitments carried forward. already in 2013, upon financial independence, c8 commitments amounting to 40 million euro were migrated from dg home to the agency. at the same time, the 2014, 2015 and \u2014 based on preliminary indications \u2014 2016 budgets will foresee an equalisation of commitment and payment appropriations in the agency\u2019s budget. this poses a challenge to the reduction of the volume of c8 commitments carried forward in title iii over the next years. top", "document_date":
