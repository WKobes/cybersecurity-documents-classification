2012, entitled \u2018increasing the impact of eu development policy: an agenda for change\u2019, \u2014 having regard to rule 123(2) of its rules of procedure, a. whereas the un convention on the rights of the child and the optional protocols thereto constitute the standard in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, containing a comprehensive set of international legal standards for the protection and well-being of children; b. whereas all the eu member states have ratified the un convention on the rights of the child and have clear legal obligations to promote, protect and fulfil the rights of every child in their jurisdictions; c. whereas the promotion of children\u2019s rights is an explicit objective of eu policies, and whereas the eu charter of fundamental rights requires that the best interests of the child be a primary consideration in all eu action; d. whereas the un convention on the rights of the child and the eu charter of fundamental rights respect the child\u2019s rights to be heard and to have their views on matters which concern them taken into consideration according to their age and maturity; e. whereas the rights of the child \u2014 namely the principle of the best interests of the child, the child\u2019s right to life, survival and development, non-discrimination and respect for the child\u2019s right to express an opinion \u2014 concern all eu policies; f. whereas progress has been made since the adoption of the un convention on the rights of the child 25 years ago, but whereas children\u2019s rights continue to be violated in many parts of the world, including in eu member states, as a result of violence, abuse, exploitation, poverty, social exclusion and discrimination based on religion, disability, gender, sexual identity, age, ethnicity, migration or residence status; g. whereas for rights to have meaning, all children and their families must have inclusive access to justice and fair, timely and effective remedies; h. whereas some 6,6 million children under the age of 5 died in 2012, mostly from preventable causes, and were thus deprived of their fundamental right to survive and develop; whereas 168 million children aged 5 to 17 are engaged in child labour, which compromises their right to be protected from economic exploitation and infringes their right to learn and play; whereas 11 % of girls are married before they turn 15, which jeopardises their rights to health, education and protection; whereas in sub-saharan africa 1 in every 10 children born still dies before their 5th birthday; i. whereas education \u2014 specifically free primary schooling for all children \u2014 is a fundamental right to which governments committed themselves under the 1989 un convention on the rights of the child; whereas the target for 2015 is to ensure that all boys and girls complete a full course of primary schooling; whereas despite some progress in the developing world, this goal is far from being achieved; j. whereas comprehensive sexuality education is an integral and important part of strengthening boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 rights to well-being and health, promoting equality and fighting stereotypes; k. whereas humanitarian crises continue to have a devastating impact on children, and whereas in 2014 the lives of more than 59 million children were directly affected by crises, mainly conflict-related; whereas there are an estimated 250 000 child soldiers in the world today, 40 % of whom are girls; l. whereas in 2012 alone almost 95 000 children and adolescents under the age of 20 were victims of homicide, almost 1 billion children aged between 2 and 14 were subjected to physical punishment, one in three adolescents aged between 13 and 15 experienced bullying and around 70 million girls aged between 15 and 19 were victims of some form of physical violence, and whereas 120 million girls worldwide have experienced forced intercourse or other forced sexual acts at some point in their lives; m. whereas children make up half the population in developing countries, and whereas around 100 million children live in the eu; n. whereas according to the latest united nations children\u2019s fund (unicef) report card on child poverty in rich countries, 2,6 million children have sunk below the poverty line in the world\u2019s most affluent countries since 2008, bringing the total number of children in the developed world living in poverty to an estimated 76,5 million; whereas according to the same study, 7,5 million young people in the eu were classified as neets (not in employment, education or training) in 2013; o. whereas violence against children takes many forms, including psychological, physical, sexual, emotional and verbal abuse, neglect and deprivation, and occurs in many settings, including the home, the school, the health care and justice systems, the workplace, communities and online; p. whereas the eu agenda on the rights of the child outlines a clear framework for eu action, and whereas its implementation has resulted in significant progress in a number of key areas of action and legislation, including establishing missing children hotlines, promoting child-friendly justice, improving data collection and integrating children\u2019s rights into external action; q. whereas every child is first and foremost a child whose rights should be fulfilled without discrimination, regardless of their or their parents\u2019 ethnic origin, nationality or social, migration or residence status; r. whereas girls and boys experience both similar and different expectations and forms of socialisation, and whereas the discrimination experienced by girls and boys differs at different ages; s. whereas although substantial progress has been made, in particular in the fields of trafficking, sexual exploitation and victims\u2019 rights, and for asylum-seeking and unaccompanied children, much more needs to be done to ensure that the rights of migrant children are fully respected across the eu; whereas many unaccompanied children disappear and abscond after their first arrival in the eu and are particularly vulnerable to abuse; t. whereas, given its international nature, child exploitation and child sexual exploitation online \u2014 including the proliferation of child sexual exploitation material on the internet and cyber predation \u2014 continues to be a major concern for law enforcement authorities, with offences ranging from sexual extortion and grooming to self-produced child abuse material and live streaming, which pose particular investigative challenges owing to technological innovations that provide easier and faster access to material for offenders, including cyber predators; u. whereas children are particularly affected by poverty and by cuts in social security systems and key social benefits such as family allowances, and whereas such cuts have increased in the eu since 2007; whereas in the eu, even after the social transfers, the child poverty risk rate remains very high (20,3 % in 2013); v. whereas the post-2015 framework for global development will represent an opportunity to invest in the rights of all children, in every place in the world \u2014 regardless of the child\u2019s gender, ethnicity, race or economic, disability or other status; 1. considers that children\u2019s rights are at the heart of eu policies and that the 25th anniversary of the un convention on the rights of the child is an opportunity to ensure its full implementation in policy and in practice and to take additional measures to ensure respect for the rights of every child everywhere, especially the most vulnerable; 2. welcomes the eu\u2019s commitment under the stockholm programme to develop an

calls on the commission to propose an ambitious and comprehensive child rights strategy and action plan for the next five years, building on and upgrading the eu agenda on the rights of the child; 3.

its recommendation entitled \u2018investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u2019 in the member states and to ensure access to quality services and participation of children; calls on

calls on the eu and its member states to make the millennium development goals the top priority in their internal policies and their relations with third countries; highlights the fact that these objectives, especially poverty eradication, access to education for all and gender equality, will only be achieved through the development of public services which are accessible to all; 6. calls on the commission and the member states to integrate an explicit child and youth focus in the european semester, the annual growth survey and a revised europe 2020 strategy in order to better implement

action to ensure that all children can effectively access justice systems that are tailored to their specific needs and rights, whether as suspects, perpetrators, victims or parties to proceedings;

of children living in detention facilities with their parents; underlines the fact that an estimated 800 000 children in the eu are separated from an imprisoned parent each year, which impacts on the rights of children in multiple ways; 14. considers that children are vulnerable in their access to goods and services; calls on the business community and stakeholders to refrain from aggressive and misleading advertising to children, both online and offline, including by implementing existing codes of conduct and similar initiatives; considers that advertising aimed at children for food with high fat, salt or sugar content should be done responsibly, bearing in mind the increase in child obesity and diabetes; 15. considers that children\u2019s personal data online must be duly protected

be prohibited; considers that all children should have the right to enjoy a healthy and safe environment and access to play; 16. calls on the member states to implement directive 2011/36/eu on

also for the member states and the eu to strengthen police and judicial cooperation with a view to preventing and prosecuting such crimes; calls on the member states to take measures to combat the illicit transfer of children, to work in cooperation with third countries to address the growing problem of child smuggling and trafficking, and to prosecute traffickers, with appropriate sanctions;

18. calls for the eu and its member states to invest in public services for children, including childcare, education and health, and particularly in extending the public network of kindergartens, nurseries and public utility services offering leisure activities for children; 19. given that the first levels of education do not always guarantee the necessary basic standard of learning, calls on

to safeguard and strengthen maternity and paternity rights in order to provide a healthy, stable environment for children in the first months of their lives; 21. calls on the member states to

unaccompanied minors in the eu; calls on the member states to take action to end the detention of migrant children across the eu; welcomes the court of justice judgment in case c-648/11 ma, bt, da v secretary of state for the home department , which stated that the member state responsible for examining an asylum application made in more than one member state by an unaccompanied minor is the state in which the minor is present after having lodged an application there; recalls that an unaccompanied minor is above all a child who is potentially in danger and that child protection, rather than immigration policies, must be the leading principle for member states and the eu when dealing with unaccompanied minors, thus respecting the core principle of the best interests of the child; 24. calls on all the member states to implement the standards set out in the un convention on the rights of the child for children deprived of parental care, and in the un guidelines for the alternative
