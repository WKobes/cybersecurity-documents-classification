( 2 ) oj c 74 e, 20.3.2008, p. 562 . wednesday 24 september 2008 p6_tc2-cod(2005)0241 position of the european parliament adopted at second reading on 24 september 2008 with a view to the adoption of regulation (ec) no \u2026/2008 of the european parliament and of the council on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of an accident (text with eea relevance) the european parliament and the council of the european union, having regard to the treaty establishing the european community, and in particular article 80(2) thereof, having regard to the proposal from the commission, having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee ( 1 ) , having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions ( 2 ) , acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 251 of the treaty ( 3 ) , whereas: (1) within the framework of the common transport policy, it is necessary to adopt further measures \u2551 to enhance safety in maritime transport. these measures include liability rules for damage caused to passengers, since it is important to ensure an appropriate level of compensation for passengers involved in maritime accidents. (2) the protocol of 2002 to the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea, 1974 was adopted on 1 november 2002 under the auspices of the international maritime organization (imo). the community and its member states are in the process of deciding whether to accede to or ratify that protocol. (3) the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea , 1974, as amended by the protocol of 2002 (\u2551 \u2018the athens convention\u2019), applies to international transport only. the distinction between national and international transport has been eliminated within the internal market in maritime transport services , and it is therefore appropriate that the same level and nature of liability apply to both international and national transport within the community. (4) the insurance arrangements required under the athens convention must be appropriate to the financial means of ship-owners and insurance companies. ship-owners must be in a position to manage their insurance arrangements in an economically acceptable way and, particularly in the case of small shipping companies operating national transport services, account must be taken of the seasonal nature of their operations. the transitional period which is provided for in the application of this regulation must be sufficiently long as to enable the compulsory insurance provided for by the athens convention to be arranged without affecting existing insurance schemes. (5) it is appropriate to oblige the carrier to make an advance payment in the event of the death of or personal injury to a passenger, whereby advance payment does not constitute recognition of liability. (6) appropriate, full and comprehensible information on new rights being conferred on passengers should be provided to those passengers prior to their journey. (7) any amendment to the athens convention will be incorporated into community legislation, unless that amendment is excluded following the procedure under article 5(2) of regulation (ec) no 2099/2002 of the european parliament and of the council of 5 november 2002 establishing a committee on safe seas and the prevention of pollution from ships (coss) ( 4 ) . (8) the legal committee of the imo adopted on 19 october 2006 the imo reservation and guidelines for the implementation of the athens convention (\u2551\u2018the imo guidelines\u2019) to address certain issues under the athens convention, such as, in particular, compensation for terrorism-related damage. \u2551 as such, the imo guidelines may be considered a lex specialis. (9) this regulation incorporates and makes binding parts of the imo guidelines. to achieve that result , where it occurs in the provisions of the imo guidelines, the verb \u2018should\u2019 should, in particular, be understood as \u2018shall\u2019. (10) the provisions of the athens convention (annex i) and of the imo guidelines (annex ii) should be understood, mutatis mutandis, in the context of community legislation. (11) the matters covered by articles 17 and 17bis of the athens convention fall within the exclusive competence of the \u2551 community insofar as those articles affect the rules established by council regulation (ec) no 44/2001 of 22 december 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( 5 ) . to that extent, those articles will form part of the community legal order when the \u2551 community accedes to the athens convention. (12) for the purposes of this regulation , the expression \u2018or is registered in a member state\u2019 should be interpreted to mean that the flag state for the purposes of bareboat charter-out registration is \u2551 either a member state or a contracting party to the athens convention. necessary steps should be taken by the member states and the commission to invite the imo to develop guidelines on the concept of bareboat charter-out registration. (13) for the purposes of this regulation , the expression \u2018mobility equipment\u2019 should be considered as covering neither \u2551 luggage nor vehicles within the meaning of article 8 of the athens convention. (14) the measures necessary for the implementation of this regulation should be adopted in accordance with council decision 1999/468/ec of 28 june 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the commission ( 6 ) . (15) in particular, the commission should be empowered to amend this regulation in order to incorporate subsequent amendments to the international conventions, protocols, codes and resolutions related thereto. since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in article 5a of decision 1999/468/ec. (16) the european maritime safety agency (\u2018the agency\u2019) , established by regulation (ec) no 1406/2002 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 june 2002 ( 7 ) , should assist the commission in preparing and drafting a progress report on the functioning of the new rules. (17) owing to the need for greater consultation among the member states on matters of maritime safety, it is vital to reassess the agency's competences and possibly to consider extending its powers. (18) the national authorities, particularly the port authorities, play a fundamental and vital role in identifying and managing the various risks in relation to maritime safety. \u2590 (19) since the objective of this regulation, namely to create a single set of rules governing the rights of carriers by sea and their passengers in the event of an accident, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by reason of the need to ensure identical limits of liability for accidents in all member states, be better achieved at community level, the community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty. in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that article, this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, have adopted this regulation: article 1 subject-matter this regulation lays down the community regime relating to liability and insurance for the carriage of passengers by sea as set out in the relevant provisions of: (a) the athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea, 1974, as amended by

committee of the imo on 19 october 2006 (\u2551\u2018the imo guidelines\u2019) , as set out in annex ii. furthermore, this regulation extends the application of those provisions to carriage of

to repairs. \u2590 article 5 advance payment where the death of, or personal injury to, a passenger is caused by a shipping incident \u2590 , the carrier who actually performed the whole or a part of

identification of the person entitled to damages. in the event of the death or absolute and permanent invalidity of a passenger, or injuries to 75 % or more of a passenger's body which are considered clinically very serious, this payment shall not be less than eur 21 000. this article shall also apply where the carrier is established within the community. an advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability. it may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of this regulation and may not be returned , except in the cases described in article 3(1) and article 6 of the athens convention and appendix a of the imo guidelines , or where the person who received it is not the person entitled to damages. payment or receipt, as appropriate, of an advance payment shall entitle the carrier, the performing carrier or the passenger to initiate judicial proceedings to establish liability and fault. article 6 information to passengers the carrier and / or performing carrier shall ensure that passengers are provided with appropriate , full and comprehensible information regarding their rights under this regulation prior to their departure. to the extent that such

be in the official language or languages of the issuing state. if the language used is not english, french or spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages, and, where the state so decides, the official language of the state may be omitted. 5. the certificate shall be carried on board the ship, and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a state party, with the authority of the state issuing or certifying the certificate. 6. an insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 5, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. the foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or other financial security no longer satisfying the requirements of this article. 7. the state of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate. 8. nothing in this convention shall be construed as preventing a state party from relying on information obtained from other states or the organization or other international organizations relating to the financial standing of providers of insurance or other financial security for the purposes of this convention. in such cases, the state party relying on such information is not relieved of its responsibility as a state issuing the certificate. 9. certificates issued or certified under the authority of a state party shall be accepted by other states parties for the purposes of this convention and shall be regarded by other states parties as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them, even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a state party. a state party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying state should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the insurance certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this convention. 10. any claim for compensation covered by insurance or other financial security pursuant to this article may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security . in such case, the amount set out in paragraph 1 applies as the limit of liability of the insurer or other person providing financial security , even if the carrier or the performing carrier is not entitled to limitation of liability. the defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up) which the carrier referred to in paragraph 1 would have been entitled to invoke in accordance with this convention. furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the assured, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the assured against the defendant. the defendant shall in any event have the right to require the carrier and the performing carrier to be joined in the proceedings. 11. any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this convention, and any payments made of such sums shall discharge any liability arising under this convention to the extent of the amounts paid. 12. a state party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this article applies to operate at any time unless a certificate has been issued under paragraphs 2 or 15. 13. subject to the provisions of this article, each state party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other financial security , to the extent specified in paragraph 1, is in force in respect of any ship that is licensed to carry more than twelve passengers, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory in so far as this convention applies. 14. notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a state party may notify the secretary-general that, for the purposes of paragraph 13, ships are not required to carry on board or to produce the certificate required by paragraph 2 when entering or leaving ports in its territory, provided that the state party which issues the certificate has notified the secretary-general that it maintains records in an electronic format, accessible to all states parties, attesting the existence of the certificate and enabling states parties to discharge their obligations under paragraph 13. 15. if insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a state party, the provisions of this article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the state of the ship's registry, stating that the ship is owned by that state and that the liability is covered within the amount prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. such a certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2. article 5 valuables the carrier shall not be liable for the loss of or damage to monies, negotiable securities, gold, silverware, jewellery, ornaments, works of art, or other valuables, except where such valuables have been deposited with the carrier for the agreed purpose of safe-keeping in which case the carrier shall be liable up to the limit provided for in paragraph 3 of article 8 unless a higher limit is agreed upon in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 10. article 6
